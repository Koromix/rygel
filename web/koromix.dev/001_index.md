# Koffi

Koffi is a fast and easy-to-use C FFI module for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), featuring:

* Low-overhead and fast performance (see [benchmarks](https://koffi.dev/benchmarks))
* Support for primitive and aggregate data types (structs and fixed-size arrays), both by reference (pointer) and by value
* Javascript functions can be used as C callbacks (since 1.2.0)
* Well-tested code base for popular OS/architecture combinations

The following combinations of OS and architectures __are officially supported and tested__ at the moment:

ISA / OS           | Windows     | Linux    | macOS       | FreeBSD     | OpenBSD

# TyTools

TyTools is a collection of **independent tools** and you only need one executable to use any of them. The Qt-based GUI tools are statically compiled to make that possible.

Tool        | Type                      | Description
----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TyCommander | Qt GUI (static)           | Upload, monitor and communicate with multiple boards
TyUpdater   | Qt GUI (static)           | Simple firmware / sketch uploader
tycmd       | Command-line<br>_No Qt !_ | Command-line tool to manage Teensy boards

# libhs

libhs is a cross-platform C library to enumerate **HID and serial devices** and interact with them.

It is distributed as a **single-file header**. Drop the file in your project, add one define for the implementation and start to code without messing around with an arcane build system.

Find out more on the [page dedicated to libhs](libhs).
