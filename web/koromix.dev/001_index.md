# Introduction

Hi visitor!

My name is **Niels Martign√®ne**, and I've been a programmer for over twenty years. It all began when I stumbled upon an old [Amstrad CPC-6128](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC#CPC6128) in my parents' attic, and found out you could use BASIC to program simple games on it.

Nowadays I work on various **C++ applications/libraries**, and some **web applications**. I also do some C and assembly programming. You can find information about some of the open-source projects I've worked on over the years on this website.

I'm **available for hire**, please contact me on [niels.martignene@protonmail.com](mailto:niels.martignene@protonmail.com) if you are interested.

# Main projects

## Goupile

Goupile is an **open-source electronic data capture** application that strives to make form creation and data entry both powerful and easy.

Find out more on the [page dedicated to Goupile](goupile).

## Koffi

Koffi is a **fast and easy-to-use JS to C FFI module** for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), featuring:

* Low-overhead and fast performance (see [benchmarks](https://koffi.dev/benchmarks))
* Support for primitive and aggregate data types (structs and fixed-size arrays), both by reference (pointer) and by value
* Javascript functions can be used as C callbacks (since 1.2.0)
* Well-tested code base for popular OS/architecture combinations

Find out more on the [page dedicated to Koffi](koffi).

## TyTools

TyTools is a collection of **independent tools** and you only need one executable to use any of them. The Qt-based GUI tools are statically compiled to make that possible.

Tool        | Type                      | Description
----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TyCommander | Qt GUI (static)           | Upload, monitor and communicate with multiple boards
TyUpdater   | Qt GUI (static)           | Simple firmware / sketch uploader
tycmd       | Command-line<br>_No Qt !_ | Command-line tool to manage Teensy boards

Find out more on the [page dedicated to TyTools](tytools).

## libhs

libhs is a cross-platform C library to enumerate **HID and serial devices** and interact with them.

It is distributed as a **single-file header**. Drop the file in your project, add one define for the implementation and start to code without messing around with an arcane build system.

Find out more on the [page dedicated to libhs](libhs).
