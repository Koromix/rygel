#tytools# TyTools

TyTools is a collection of **independent tools** and you only need one executable to use
any of them. The Qt-based GUI tools are statically compiled to make that possible.

Tool        | Type                      | Description
----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TyCommander | Qt GUI (static)           | Upload, monitor and communicate with multiple boards
TyUpdater   | Qt GUI (static)           | Simple firmware / sketch uploader
tycmd       | Command-line<br>_No Qt !_ | Command-line tool to manage Teensy boards

Find out more on the [page dedicated to TyTools](tytools).

#libhs# libhs

libhs is a cross-platform C library to enumerate **HID and serial devices** and interact with them.

It is distributed as a **single-file header**. Drop the file in your project, add one define for the implementation and start to code without messing around with an arcane build system.

#koffi# Koffi

Koffi is a fast and easy-to-use FFI module for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), with support for complex data types such as structs.
