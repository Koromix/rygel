        <p>Hi visitor!
        <p>My name is <b>Niels Martign√®ne</b> (or <a href="https://github.com/Koromix" target="_blank">Koromix</a>), and I've been a programmer for over twenty years. It all began when I stumbled upon an old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC#CPC6128" target="_blank">Amstrad CPC-6128</a> in my parents' attic, and found out you could use BASIC to program simple games on it.
        <p>Nowadays I work on various <b>C++ applications/libraries</b>, and some <b>web applications</b>. I also do some C and assembly programming. You can find information about some of the open-source projects I've worked on over the years on this website.
        <p>I'm <b>available for hire</b>, please contact me on <a href="mailto:niels.martignene@protonmail.com">niels.martignene@protonmail.com</a> if you are interested.
