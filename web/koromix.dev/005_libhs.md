# Overview

libhs is a **C library to enumerate HID and serial devices** and interact with them.

- *single-file*: one header is all you need to make it work.
- *public domain*: use it, hack it, do whatever you want.
- *multiple platforms*: Windows (≥ XP), Mac OS X (≥ 10.9) and Linux.
- *multiple compilers*: MSV (≥ 2015), GCC and Clang.
- *driverless*: uses native OS-provided interfaces and does not require custom drivers.

# Build

Just [download libhs.h from the GitHub repository](https://github.com/Koromix/libraries). This file
provides both the interface and the implementation. To instantiate the implementation, `#define
HS_IMPLEMENTATION` in *ONE* source file, before including libhs.h.

libhs depends on **a few OS-provided libraries** that you need to link:

OS                  | Dependencies
------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows (MSVC)      | Nothing to do, libhs uses `#pragma comment(lib)`
Windows (MinGW-w64) | Link `-luser32 -ladvapi32 -lsetupapi -lhid`
OSX (Clang)         | Link _CoreFoundation and IOKit_
Linux (GCC)         | Link `-ludev`

This library is developed as part of the TyTools project where you can find the original
[libhs source code](https://github.com/Koromix/tytools/tree/master/src/libhs). The
amalgamated header file is automatically produced by CMake scripts.

Look at [Sean Barrett's excellent stb libraries](https://github.com/nothings/stb) for the
reasoning behind this mode of distribution.

# Contribute

You can clone the code and report bugs on the [TyTools GitHub
repository](https://github.com/Koromix/tytools).

# Examples

You can find a few complete [working examples in the GitHub
repository](https://github.com/Koromix/tytools/tree/master/src/libhs/examples).

The following code uses libhs to enumerate serial and HID devices:
