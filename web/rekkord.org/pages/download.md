A signed Debian repository is provided, and should work with Debian 11 and Debian derivatives (such as Ubuntu).

Execute the following commands (as root) to add the repository to your system:

```sh
mkdir -p -m0755 /etc/apt/keyrings
curl https://download.koromix.dev/debian/koromix-archive-keyring.gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/koromix-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/koromix-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.koromix.dev/debian stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/koromix.dev-stable.list
```

Once this is done, refresh the repository cache and install the package:

```sh
apt update
apt install rekkord
```
