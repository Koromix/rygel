            <p>Goupile is a tool designed to help users create and run electronical Clinical Report Forms (eCRF). It is a multi-platform and multi-support web application intended to collect the information defined by clinical research protocols.</p>
            <h2 id="intro_ecrf">Contribution of eCRFs</h2>
            <p>The eCRF is the electronic side of the traditional paper CRF. ECRF enables online data collection by investigators and clinical research associates (CRAs).</p>
            <p>Its main contributions are multiple:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Centralization and simplification of data entry: data entry is carried out online on a secure access portal and via an electronic form adapted to the study</li>
                <li>Securing data collection: the data is hosted on a secure server and accessible only to authorized persons</li>
                <li>Consistency control and data quality optimization: configurable and automated input masks and internal consistency checks limit input errors</li>
                <li>Monitoring of the completeness of the data and monitoring of the collection: the control of the collection is ensured through the implementation of a dashboard, monitoring indicators and an audit trail that can be consulted remotely.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="intro_plus">Goupile contribution</h2>
            <p>Goupile is an online eCRF editor that is fully user-configurable through a simplified interface and has advanced features.</p>

            <p>A new window appears ("Creating a project"). You must define a project key ("Project key"), a project name ("Name") and you will have the choice to add (or not) default pages ("Add default pages").</p>
            <p>The project key will appear in the project login URL. Its format must be alphanumeric and cannot exceed 24 characters. Uppercase letters, accents and special characters are not allowed (except the short dash or dash of 6, '-'). The name of the project corresponds to the name you want to give to your project, and will be visible to the user as the browser page title. Its format can be numeric or alphanumeric. Uppercase and special characters are allowed. The "default pages" allow the addition of a few sample pages allowing you to familiarize yourself with the design of an eCRF with Goupile and provide a first working basis. If you are already familiar with designing an eCRF with Pin, you can click "no". After completing the various fields, click on "Create" [1].</p>

            <p>By default, projects are single-center. To transform a single-center project into a multi-center project, you can use the "Divide" option.</p>
            <p>The <b>"Divide" option</b> allows you to subdivide your initial project into different sub-projects. A new window appears ("Division of *your project key*"). You must then enter a subproject key ("Subproject key") and a subproject name ("Name") according to the same constraints as those mentioned for the key and the name of the project. After completing the various fields, click on "Create" [1].</p>

                <p>Examples of predefined widgets, with the code on the left and the result on the right</p>
            </div>
            <p>Widgets are created by calling predefined functions with the following syntax:</p>
            <p class="code"><span style="color: #24579d;">function</span> ( <span style="color: #c09500;">"variable_name"</span> , <span style="color: #842d3d;">"Label presented to the user"</span> )</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Variable names must begin with a letter or _, followed by zero or more alphanumeric characters or _. They must not contain spaces, accented characters or any other special character.</p>
            <p>Most widgets accept optional parameters like this:</p>
            <p class="code"><span style="color: #24579d;">function</span> ( <span style="color: #c09500;">"variable_name"</span> , <span style="color: #842d3d;">"Label presented to the user"</span> , {
    <span style="color: #054e2d;">option1</span> : <span style="color: #431180;">value</span>,
    <span style="color: #054e2d;">option2</span> : <span style="color: #431180;">value</span>
} )</p>
            <p>Pay attention to the syntax of the code. When the parentheses or quotes do not match, an error occurs and the displayed page cannot be updated until the error persists. The <a href="#dev_errors">section on errors</a> has more information on this.</p>
