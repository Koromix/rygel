# Bugs and Feature Requests

Use our [online ticket tracking tool](https://codeberg.org/Koromix/goupile/issues) to request new features or report bugs.

# Code

The source code is available in [our git repository](https://codeberg.org/Koromix/rygel).

Please note, this is a **monorepo** that contains several projects. The specific code for Goupile is located in `src/goupile`, but it references several other libraries (both internal and external) within this repository.

> [!NOTE]
> Most of my projects live in a single repository (or monorepo), which have two killer features for me:
>
> - Cross-project refactoring
> - Simplified dependency management
>
