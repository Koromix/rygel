/**
 * @file microhttpd/mhd_locks.h
 * @brief  Header for platform-independent locks abstraction
 * @author Karlson2k (Evgeny Grin)
 * @author Christian Grothoff
 *
 * Provides basic abstraction for locks/mutex.
 * Any functions can be implemented as macro on some platforms
 * unless explicitly marked otherwise.
 * Any function argument can be skipped in macro, so avoid
 * variable modification in function parameters.
 *
 * @warning Unlike pthread functions, most of functions return
 *          nonzero on success.
