/**
 * Function called after a protocol "upgrade" response was sent
 * successfully and the socket should now be controlled by some
 * protocol other than HTTP.
 *
 * Any data already received on the socket will be made available in
 * @e extra_in.  This can happen if the application sent extra data
 * before MHD send the upgrade response.  The application should
 * treat data from @a extra_in as if it had read it from the socket.
 *
 * Note that the application must not close() @a sock directly,
 * but instead use #MHD_upgrade_action() for special operations
 * on @a sock.
 *
 * Data forwarding to "upgraded" @a sock will be started as soon
 * as this function return.
 *
 * Except when in 'thread-per-connection' mode, implementations
 * of this function should never block (as it will still be called
 * from within the main event loop).
 *
 * @param cls closure, whatever was given to #MHD_create_response_for_upgrade().
 * @param connection original HTTP connection handle,
 *                   giving the function a last chance
 *                   to inspect the original HTTP request
 * @param con_cls last value left in `con_cls` of the `MHD_AccessHandlerCallback`
 * @param extra_in if we happened to have read bytes after the
 *                 HTTP header already (because the client sent
 *                 more than the HTTP header of the request before
 *                 we sent the upgrade response),
 *                 these are the extra bytes already read from @a sock
 *                 by MHD.  The application should treat these as if
 *                 it had read them from @a sock.
 * @param extra_in_size number of bytes in @a extra_in
 * @param sock socket to use for bi-directional communication
 *        with the client.  For HTTPS, this may not be a socket
 *        that is directly connected to the client and thus certain
 *        operations (TCP-specific setsockopt(), getsockopt(), etc.)
 *        may not work as expected (as the socket could be from a
 *        socketpair() or a TCP-loopback).  The application is expected
 *        to perform read()/recv() and write()/send() calls on the socket.
 *        The application may also call shutdown(), but must not call
 *        close() directly.
 * @param urh argument for #MHD_upgrade_action()s on this @a connection.
 *        Applications must eventually use this callback to (indirectly)
 *        perform the close() action on the @a sock.
