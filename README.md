# Introduction

CNoke is a simpler alternative to CMake.js, without any dependency, designed to build
native Node addons based on CMake.

Install it like this:

```sh
npm install cnoke
```

It obviously requires [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/download/) and a proper C/C++ toolchain:

* Windows: Visual C++ Build Tools or a recent version of Visual C++ will do (the free Community version works well)
* POSIX (Linux, macOS, etc.): Clang or GCC, and Make (Ninja is preferred if available)

# Get started

In order to build a ntive Node.js addon with CNoke, you can use the following CMakeLists.txt
template to get started:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.11)
project(hello C CXX)

add_library(hello SHARED hello.cc ${NODE_JS_SRC})
set_target_properties(hello PROPERTIES PREFIX "" SUFFIX ".node")
target_include_directories(hello PRIVATE ${NODE_JS_INC})
target_link_libraries(hello PRIVATE ${NODE_JS_LIB})
```

In order for this to run when `npm install` runs (directly or when someone else installs
your dependency), add the following script to package.json:

```json
"scripts": {
    "install": "cnoke"
}
```

# Command usage

You can find the same help text by running `cnoke --help`:
