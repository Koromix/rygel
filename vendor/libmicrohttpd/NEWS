Released GNU libmicrohttpd 0.9.73

    This release brings new features, improvements, and a few fixes.
    The most important addition is the new function for vector-backed
    responses, based on the patch contributed by NASA engineers.
    Other changes include compatibility with autoconf 2.70+, improved
    testsuite compatibility with CI systems, fixed and improved MSVC
    builds, and implemention of ALPN support.

    More detailed list of notable changes:

    API changes:
    + Added new function MHD_create_response_from_iovec(), based on the
      patch provided by Lawrence Sebald and Damon N. Earp from NASA.
    + Added MHD_OPTION_SIGPIPE_HANDLED_BY_APP daemon option.
    + Added new function MHD_run_wait().
    + Added MHD_OPTION_TLS_NO_ALPN to disable usage of ALPN even if
      it is supported by TLS library.

    New features:
    + Added '--enable-heavy-tests' configure parameter (disabled by
      default).
    + Implemented support for ALPN.

    Improvements and enhancements:
    * Return timeout of zero also for connections awaiting cleanup.
    * Compatibility with autoconf >=2.70, used new autoconf features.
    * Warn user when custom logger option is not the first option.
    * Added information to the header about minimal MHD version when
      particular symbols were introduced.
    * Updated test certificates to be compatible with modern browsers.
    * Added on-fly detection of UNIX domain sockets and pipes, MHD does
      not try to use TCP/IP-specific socket options on them.
    * Report more detailed error description in the MHD log for send
      and receive errors.
    * Enabled bind port autodetection for MSVC builds.

    Fixes:
    # Fix PostProcessor to always properly stop iteration when
      application callback tells it to do so.
    # Fixed MD5 digest authorization broken when compiled without
      variable length arrays support (notably with MSVC).
    # Fixed detection of type of send errors on W32.

Released GNU libmicrohttpd 0.9.72

    This release is mostly a bugfix release, with greatly improved
    compatibility with various OSes/kernels, including FreeBSD, Windows,
    OpenBSD, NetBSD, Darwin (macOS), Solaris. Performance is improved,
    especially with HTTPS connections and stay-alive HTTP connections.

    Notable changes since version 0.9.71:

    API changes:
    + New function MHD_create_response_from_pipe()

    Improvements and enhancements:
    * Fully rewritten code for buffering/pushing from kernel network buffers
      for compatibility with various OSes. Reduced number of additional
      sys-calls, network is better utilized, responses are delivered faster.
    * Restored optimal sendfile() usage on FreeBSD.
    * MHD now takes care about SIGPIPE handling by blocking it in internal
      threads and avoiding functions (like sendfile()) that could generate
      SIGPIPE when blocking of this signal is not possible.

    Fixes:
    # Fixed crash in PostProcessor.
    # Fixed several resources leaks in corner cases.
    # Improved thread sync, thread safety and fixed one use-after-free under
      special conditions during stopping of daemon.
    # Updated HTTP status codes, header names and methods from the
      registries.
    # Fixed functioning without listen socket and with internal threads.
    # Fixed streaming of chunked responses for both HTTP and HTTPS.
    # Various compatibility fixes.
