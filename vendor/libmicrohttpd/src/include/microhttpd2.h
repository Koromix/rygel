/**
 * Just includes the NEW definitions for the NG-API.
 * Note that we do not indicate which of the OLD APIs
 * simply need to be kept vs. deprecated.
 *
 *
 * The goal is to provide a basis for discussion!
 * Little of this is implemented yet.
 *
 * Main goals:
 * - simplify application callbacks by splitting header/upload/post
 *   functionality currently provided by calling the same
 *   MHD_AccessHandlerCallback 3+ times into separate callbacks.
 * - keep the API very simple for simple requests, but allow
 *   more complex logic to be incrementally introduced
 *   (via new struct MHD_Action construction)
 * - avoid repeated scans for URL matches via the new
 *   struct MHD_Action construction
 * - provide default logarithmic implementation of URL scan
 *   => reduce strcmp(url) from >= 3n operations to "log n"
 *      per request.
 * - better types, in particular avoid varargs for options
 * - make it harder to pass inconsistent options
 * - combine options and flags into more uniform API (at least
 *   exterally!)
 * - simplify API use by using sane defaults (benefiting from
 *   breaking backwards compatibility) and making all options
 *   really optional, and where applicable avoid having options
 *   where the default works if nothing is specified
 * - simplify API by moving rarely used http_version into
 *   MHD_request_get_information()
 * - avoid 'int' for MHD_YES/MHD_NO by introducing `enum MHD_Bool`
 * - improve terminology by eliminating confusion between
 *   'request' and 'connection'
 * - prepare API for having multiple TLS backends
 * - use more consistent prefixes for related functions
 *   by using MHD_subject_verb_object naming convention, also
 *   at the same time avoid symbol conflict with legacy names
 *   (so we can have one binary implementing old and new
 *   library API at the same time via compatibility layer).
 * - make it impossible to queue a response at the wrong time
 * - make it impossible to suspend a connection/request at the
 *   wrong time (improves thread-safety)
 * - make it clear which response status codes are "properly"
 *   supported (include the descriptive string) by using an enum;
 * - simplify API for common-case of one-shot responses by
 *   eliminating need for destroy response in most cases;
 *
 * TODO:
 * - varargs in upgrade is still there and ugly (and not even used!)
 * - migrate event loop apis (get fdset, timeout, MHD_run(), etc.)
