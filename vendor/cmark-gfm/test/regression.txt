Footnotes may begin with or have a 'w' or a '_' in their reference label.

```````````````````````````````` example footnotes autolink
This is some text. Sometimes the autolinker splits up text into multiple nodes, hoping it will find a hyperlink, so this text has a footnote whose reference label begins with a `w`.[^widely-cited]

It has another footnote that contains many different characters (the autolinker was also breaking on `_`).[^sphinx-of-black-quartz_judge-my-vow-0123456789]
