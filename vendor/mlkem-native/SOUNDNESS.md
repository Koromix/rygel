# Formal Verification in mlkem-native: Scope, Assumptions, Risks

This document describes the scope, assumptions and risks of the formal verification
efforts around mlkem-native.

The parts of the analysis pertaining to HOL Light and s2n-bignum are largely shared with
the corresponding s2n-bignum soundness document[^s2n-bignum-soundness].

We see this as a living document. If you have suggestions for improvements, such as soundness risks
missing from or insufficiently covered in this document, please reach out to us or open an issue.
However, if you find a potential security vulnerability in mlkem-native, do **not** open
a public GitHub issue, but instead use [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native/security).

## Overview

Formal verification is never absolute. Every verification effort links formal objects --
specifications and models -- to informal, real-world requirements and systems. This document
maps out what is proved about mlkem-native, what is assumed, and where the gaps and risks lie.

Our goal is to provide evidence rooted in formal reasoning for the statement that
"mlkem-native implements the FIPS203 standard[^FIPS203] and does not leak secrets through timing variations".

The narrative for the argument is the following, which is common in formal verification:
- [Informal] Here is the real physical system, in all its complexity.
- [Formal] Here is a formal model of the real system which we believe approximates its behavior.
- [Formal] Here is how we can formally specify the behavior of this formal model.
- [Formal] Here is how we formally prove the formal specification.
- [Informal] Here is why we think this approximates the desired properties of the real system.

Diagrammatically, this can be depicted as follows:

```

                                                  "Here is how we can formally specify

                                                   the machine's formal model."

This methodology introduces three fundamental soundness gaps:
- Gap A: Does the formal specification capture what we want to say about the real system?
- Gap B: Is the formal model a faithful reflection of the real system?
- Gap C: Is the formal argument trustworthy for why the formal model satisfies its specification?

For mlkem-native, this structure is instantiated twice -- once for each verification
stack.

- **CBMC[^CBMC]** for the C code: memory safety, type safety, and absence of undefined behavior.
- **HOL-Light[^HOL-Light] + s2n-bignum[^s2n-bignum]** for the assembly backends: functional correctness, memory safety, and secret-independent
  execution.

## Gap A: Do the formal specifications match actual requirements?

This is the gap between what we *specify* and what users and applications actually *need*.
It has multiple facets, including: Whether all system components are covered by specification (breadth),
whether the specifications are strong enough (depth), whether they faithfully capture the informal requirements
(faithfulness), and whether they compose to a claim about the whole system (consistency).

### A1. Coverage: Breadth

Which components of the system are captured by formal specification? The primary risk is
that our coverage claims are wrong -- that a C or assembly function slips through without
a specification, or that an unspecified component is incorrect.

**What is covered.**

- All C code in the core library has CBMC contracts.
- All AArch64 assembly routines have HOL Light specifications.
- All x86_64 assembly routines have HOL Light specifications.

**What is NOT covered.**

- **Backends for platforms other than AArch64 and x86_64** (e.g. RISC-V RVV, Armv8.1-M MVE, PowerPC):
  Where present, these are not yet covered by specification.

The full test suite (functional tests, KAT, ACVP, Wycheproof[^wycheproof], unit tests) validates functional
correctness empirically across all platforms and configurations, but there is currently
no automatic coverage check for CBMC or HOL Light. A function or configuration could slip
through without being covered by specification.

**Potential improvements.**
- Add automatic proof coverage check to CI. ([#1423](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native/issues/1423), [#1594](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native/issues/1594))
- Add verification coverage for all backends, using existing or new methodologies ([#1595](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native/issues/1595)).

### A2. Coverage: Depth

Do the specifications have the desired depth? The risk is that undesired behavior occurs
which is outside the scope of specification.

We aim for mlkem-native to be **functionally correct** (the code computes the
right answer as per FIPS 203), **memory-safe** (it only accesses memory within
the bounds of what is provided or allocated) and **constant-time** (no
secret-dependent timing variation).

**Assembly (HOL Light).** All ASM specification capture functional correctness, memory safety,
and secret-independent execution. A special case is rejection sampling: Its assembly implementations
are safely variable-time as they operate on public data only, so they only require correctness
and safety specifications.

**C code (CBMC).** Our use of CBMC focuses on **memory safety and type safety** -- absence
of undefined behavior including out-of-bounds access, integer overflow, null pointer
dereference, division by zero, undefined shifts, and lossy type conversions. The proofs
also capture limited aspects of functional behavior in simple cases -- for example,
coefficient bounds after arithmetic operations, or the functional specification of
`mlk_ct_memcmp`. See [`proofs/cbmc/Makefile.common`](proofs/cbmc/Makefile.common) for the
full list of checked classes of undefined behavior.

The CBMC proofs do **not** currently cover:

- **Functional correctness.** There is no machine-checked proof that the C code computes
  the right answer per FIPS 203.
- **Constant-time execution.** Side-channel resistance at the C level is not formally
  proved.

These gaps are mitigated in complementary ways. The full test suite (functional tests, KAT,
ACVP, Wycheproof, unit tests) validates functional correctness empirically across all platforms and
configurations. For arithmetic correctness specifically, the most subtle bugs in ML-KEM
implementations are rare overflows in the optimized polynomial arithmetic -- precisely the
kind of bug that the type-safety and integer-overflow proofs are designed to catch: the CBMC
contracts track coefficient bounds through the arithmetic pipeline, and overflow in
intermediate computations would be flagged as undefined behavior. Constant-time properties
are tested empirically using valgrind across many compilers and optimization levels (see
the corresponding [CI job](.github/workflows/ct-tests.yml) for
the full list), and the C code uses value barriers to prevent harmful compiler optimizations.

**Potential improvements.**
- Add automatic extraction of compiler coverage documentation from CI. ([#1608](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native/issues/1608))
- Introduce additional verification tooling that allows us to express functional correctness
  and constant-time properties for the C code. ([#1597](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native/issues/1597), [#1598](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native/issues/1598))

### A3. Specification faithfulness

For the specifications that do exist, does their formal meaning capture their intent? The
risk is that a specification does not express what we informally intend it to express.

**Correctness.** The informal intent is to express that the top-level
API behaves as specified by NIST's ML-KEM standard FIPS 203. As we do not yet address
functional correctness at the C level, there is no formal specification of ML-KEM as a
whole in mlkem-native. In our current setting -- capturing functional behavior only at the
assembly level -- faithfulness requires that the HOL Light correctness specification style
faithfully captures program behavior, and that the abstract HOL functions used in the
specifications (e.g., the Number Theoretic Transform) are faithful representations of the
mathematical functions in the standard.

**Constant-time.** The informal intent is that mlkem-native does not
leak secrets through timing side channels. Since we only capture constant-time properties
at the assembly level, faithfulness requires that the HOL Light constant-time specification
style faithfully captures constant-time execution.

The s2n-bignum formal model approximates constant-time'ness as follows: It introduces the
notion of *microarchitectural events* that flags selected instructions that are known to exhibit variable timing or
influence timing otherwise (e.g., through caches): Examples are branches, load/store instructions, or variable-time
instructions such as divisions. The constant-time specifications then posit that the trace of microarchitectural events
emitted by a program can be expressed as a function of public variables such as input/output pointers or pointers
to constant tables. Conversely, and somewhat implicitly, the absence of the (typically secret)
_data_ behind those pointers as a parameter to the event-generating function implies that there
is are no secret-dependent branches, load/stores, etc. It is the responsibility of the proof-writer
to identify what is meant to be public vs. secret, and parametrize the event-generating function
accordingly.

The formal notion of constant-time'ness used in s2n-bignum does not and cannot guarantee
that the hardware executes those instructions in constant time: Unmodeled microarchitectural
effects such as speculative execution or Hertzbleed-style frequency scaling can still leak information.
Moreover, some hardware provides opt-in guarantees for a listed set of instructions -- Arm's DIT (Data Independent
Timing, Armv8.4-A onwards) and Intel's DOIT (Data Operand Independent Timing, Ice Lake onwards). We do not yet claim
full alignment between the set of instructions marked as event-generating in s2n-bignum and the set of instructions
outside of the scope of DIT/DOIT. Finally, our notion of microarchitectural event is grounded in timing as the
observable -- power and frequency-based side channels are out of scope.

**Safety.** For the bulk of the CBMC specifications which do not capture
functional correctness, memory- and type-safety are implicit in the CBMC configuration
and not explicitly stated in the CBMC contracts. Additional clauses in the CBMC contracts
(such as memory assumptions and footprint) need not be human-validated except for the top-level
API, since their adequacy is judged by the machine-checked compositionality against their
call-sites. The fidelity of CBMC specifications therefore reduces to whether the top-level
CBMC specifications capture the footprint and assumptions of the top-level FIPS 203 API,
and whether CBMC is correctly configured to include memory- and type-safety implicitly in
each function contract.

All specifications are written in a high-level mathematical style (HOL Light) or a simple
declarative style using auditable macros (CBMC), both far simpler than the implementations.
The approach to Hoare-style correctness specifications in HOL Light has been carefully audited
and is extensively used for numerous other assembly kernels in s2n-bignum, without infidelities
being detected. For CBMC, modular proof means that an insufficient specification on a callee will
cause the caller's proof to fail. Top-level CBMC specifications are straightforward as their inputs
and outputs are merely byte buffers of standardized lengths; all these buffer length values are
defined in [params.h](mlkem/src/params.h) and easily auditable to align with FIPS 203.

Residual risks remain: The constant-time specification style in HOL Light/s2n-bignum could
fail to detect a practically relevant class of variable-time execution. A supposedly constant-time
specification could erroneously include secret data as a parameter to the event-generating function.
A misconfiguration of CBMC could cause the implicit expectation of memory- and type-safety being
included in the CBMC specifications not to hold. Or, a CBMC proof could incorrectly disable a safety
check.

**Potential improvements.**
- Derive the CBMC configuration from a machine- and human-readable source documenting
  the desired configuration options and their
  meaning. ([#1599](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native/issues/1599))
- Align the notion of event-generating instruction in s2n-bignum with the set of instructions
  outside of the scope of DIT/DOIT ([s2n-bignum/#361](https://github.com/awslabs/s2n-bignum/issues/361)).
- Highlight the notion of public vs. secret data more explicitly in the s2n-bignum constant-time
  specifications, rather than implicitly in the list of parameters to the event-generating function ([s2n-bignum/#362](https://github.com/awslabs/s2n-bignum/issues/362)).
- Provide a document which explains the specification style for correctness and constant-time
  properties in HOL Light. ([#1600](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native/issues/1600))

### A4. Specification consistency

Do the individual specifications compose to a coherent claim about the whole system? The
risks are that a contract assumed during proof differs from the contract that is proved,
that a contract assumed during proof is never proved, or that the bridge between the
CBMC and HOL Light verification stacks introduces an inconsistency.

#### CBMC compositionality

When CBMC proves a function F using the contract of a callee G (via `USE_FUNCTION_CONTRACTS`),
it assumes G's contract as an axiom. The contract it assumes must be the same contract that
is proved for G in G's own proof. In mlkem-native, this is enforced structurally: each
function has a single contract written at its declaration site, and CBMC uses that same
contract both when proving the function and when assuming it as a callee. There is no
mechanism by which the "assumed" and "proved" versions can diverge.

This structural guarantee is reinforced by the
[check-contracts](scripts/check-contracts) script, which looks for CBMC functions with a
contract but no proof. Additionally, bounds assertions in CBMC specifications are mirrored
by runtime debug assertions at the beginning and end of the respective function, so that if a
function is not covered by CBMC -- erroneously or deliberately -- tests in debug mode can
still catch gross mismatches between what the caller provides/assumes and what the callee
assumes/provides.

Residual risks remain: a function's proof could be present but not run in CI (e.g., due to
a CI configuration error), or a function's proof could be absent but
[check-contracts](scripts/check-contracts) could fail to detect it due to a bug or
misconfiguration.

#### The bridge between CBMC and HOL Light

Where C code calls into assembly, the assembly function has both a HOL Light specification
(proved against the object code) and a CBMC contract (assumed by CBMC when proving the C
caller). These two specifications are written in different languages and are currently
kept in sync by hand. Failure to do so may invalidate the safety and correctness claims
for mlkem-native.

For each assembly function, the CBMC specification is typically a subset of the HOL Light
specification obtained by removing aspects of functional correctness -- which, as discussed
above, are not yet covered in CBMC. What remains are statements about memory footprint,
arithmetic bounds, and constant tables.

**Example.** For the AArch64 NTT:

- HOL Light proves: If the input coefficients satisfy `abs(ival(x i)) <= &8191`, then the output
  satisfies `abs(ival zi) <= &23594` and `(ival zi == forward_ntt (ival o x) i) (mod &3329)`.
  In other words, we provide a description of the underlying modular arithmetic function (here, the NTT),
  plus a bound on the concrete being computed.
- The CBMC contract on `mlk_ntt_asm` simplifies this to the mere bounds assertions
  `requires(array_abs_bound(p, 0, MLKEM_N, 8192))`
  and `ensures(array_abs_bound(p, 0, MLKEM_N, 23595))`, omitting the description of the
  functional behavior.
- HOL Light assumes that auxiliary arguments point to pre-computed constant tables for
  the NTT: `C_ARGUMENTS [a; z_12345; z_67] s /\ ntt_constants z_12345 z_67 s`. CBMC similarly
  assumes `requires(twiddles12345 == mlk_aarch64_ntt_zetas_layer12345)` and `requires(twiddles56 ==
  mlk_aarch64_ntt_zetas_layer67)` for the C arguments used for the constant tables.

**Mitigations.**
Both the HOL Light proofs and the CBMC contracts contain comments of the form
`/* This must be kept in sync with the HOL Light specification in ... */`
(or vice versa) to flag the manual dependency and provide a review checkpoint.
Moreover, constant tables used in the HOL Light and C code are auto-generated from the same code
in [`scripts/autogen`](scripts/autogen). This code is run as part of CI and thereby establishes that
constant tables remain in sync.
The full test suite exercises the native backend code paths, catching
gross mismatches. Furthermore, CBMC proves the C wrapper correct *assuming* the assembly
contract, so an inconsistency between the wrapper's precondition and the assembly's
precondition would typically cause the wrapper proof to fail.

Despite these safeguards, residual risks remain. A transcription error could cause the CBMC
contract on the assembly function to fail to faithfully reflect the HOL Light specification
-- e.g., an off-by-one in a bound, a missing aliasing constraint, or a wrong constant. An
ABI mismatch could cause the C calling convention assumed by the CBMC contract to differ
from the actual register/stack layout used by the assembly. And a semantic gap between the
CBMC contract language and HOL Light's logic -- for example, differing signed vs. unsigned
interpretation of bounds -- could cause the bridge to be unsound.

**Potential improvements.**
- Establish a machine-checked link between the HOL Light specifications and the CBMC
  contracts. ([#1601](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native/issues/1601))

## Gap B: Do the formal models match the actual systems?

### B1. ISA model fidelity (assembly)

The HOL Light ISA models (`arm.ml`, `x86.ml`) and their decoders (`decode.ml`) are
hand-written from the ARM and Intel architecture reference manuals. Errors in those
references, misunderstandings, or transcription mistakes could silently invalidate proofs.

**Mitigation: co-simulation testing.** s2n-bignum's CI includes a co-simulation test
(`simulator.ml` + `simulator.c`) that repeatedly picks random instruction encodings and
random register/flag states, decodes them, executes them both symbolically through the
formal model and natively on real hardware, and compares results. This exercises both the
ISA semantics and the decoder. It covers all register-to-register instruction forms with
randomized operands, as well as memory-accessing instructions via dedicated
harnesses for various addressing modes.

Where instructions have genuinely underspecified behavior -- for example, `IMUL` sets flags
differently on different x86 microarchitectures -- the s2n-bignum model reflects this
nondeterminism, and proofs are valid regardless of which behavior the hardware exhibits.

mlkem-native does not run co-simulation testing itself; it relies on s2n-bignum's CI to
validate the ISA models. Since mlkem-native uses the same ISA models and decoder as
s2n-bignum (via the shared HOL Light infrastructure), this is appropriate -- but it means
that mlkem-native's assurance for ISA model fidelity is inherited, not independently
established.

See the s2n-bignum soundness doc [^s2n-bignum-soundness] for full details.

### B2. Object code verification and reassembly (assembly)

The HOL Light proofs work at the level of object-code byte sequences, not the assembly source.
This takes the assembler out of the TCB of the proof. However, two risks remain.

**ELF loader.** An OCaml ELF loader extracts the `.text` section (and, where applicable,
the `.rodata` section) from each object file for verification. If it extracts the wrong
bytes, the proof applies to different code than what runs in production. This risk is
mitigated by the fact that the proof engineer must provide the exact byte sequence to write
the proof, so loader errors would typically cause proof failure rather than a silently
wrong proof. Additionally, function-level random testing compares assembly outputs against
C reference implementations, catching gross mismatches.

See the s2n-bignum soundness doc[^s2n-bignum-soundness] for further details on the ELF loader.

**Reassembly risk.** When mlkem-native's `.S` files are assembled on a different system --
whether by mlkem-native's own build, by a downstream consumer such as AWS-LC, or by a
cross-compilation toolchain -- there is currently no systematic check that the resulting
object code matches the bytes the proofs were verified against.
Assembler bugs, version differences, or different assembler dialects can and
do produce different object code (for example, it has been observed that some x86
assemblers swap operands of AVX2 `VPADD` instruction to reduce code size).

**Potential improvements.**
- Provide a tool to consumers for checking that assembly/compilation results contain
  the expected byte code for all native functions covered by HOL Light proofs.  ([#1602](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native/issues/1602))

### B3. Model omissions (assembly)

The formal HOL Light ISA model is a sequential, user-mode, single-core model. It does not model:

- **Caches, TLBs, or memory ordering.** Irrelevant for single-threaded sequential code,
  but means the model says nothing about concurrent use.
- **Interrupts and exceptions.** The proof assumes uninterrupted execution. In practice,
  interrupts are transparent to user-mode code on both x86 and ARM.
- **Virtual memory and page faults.** The model uses a flat address space. Page faults
  are transparent provided the OS has mapped the relevant pages.
- **Speculative execution.** The model is non-speculative. Side-channel risks from
  speculative execution (Spectre-class) are not addressed by the current proofs.
- **System registers and privilege levels.** The model covers user-mode general-purpose
  and SIMD registers only.

These omissions are standard for this class of verification and are not expected to affect
functional correctness of sequential user-mode code.

### B4. Hardware not implementing the ISA

The formal proofs assume that the physical hardware faithfully implements the ISA as
specified in the architecture reference manuals. In reality, this assumption can fail in
multiple ways:

- **CPU errata (systematic bugs).** CPUs can have bugs. Vendors published errata lists documenting
  cases where specific instructions behave incorrectly under specific conditions. If an mlkem-native
  assembly routine triggers such an erratum, the proof's guarantee does not hold on affected hardware.

- **Transient physical faults.** Cosmic rays, voltage fluctuations, thermal effects, or
  aging can cause transient bit flips in registers, memory, or logic. Such faults can
  silently corrupt computation. ECC memory mitigates memory-level faults but does not
  protect registers or execution logic.

- **Fault injection (deliberate attacks).** An adversary with physical access can
  deliberately induce faults (voltage glitching, EM injection, laser fault injection) to
  corrupt cryptographic computations. This is a well-studied attack vector against
  cryptographic implementations, particularly in embedded and smartcard contexts.

**Mitigations.**
- Co-simulation testing (see above) exercises the actual hardware and would detect systematic
  errata for the specific instructions and operand patterns tested. However, coverage is
  inherently limited by the limited scope of the CI.
- Transient faults and fault injection are entirely outside the scope of the formal model
  and the current proofs. No countermeasures (e.g., redundant computation, fault detection
  checks) are implemented.

**Residual risks.** This is a fundamental limitation shared by all software-level formal
verification: the proofs reason about an idealized machine, not the physical device. For
high-assurance deployments in physically hostile environments, additional countermeasures
at the hardware or protocol level would be needed.

### B5. C semantics model fidelity

CBMC gives meaning to C by translating C source into an internal representation and then into SMT formulas. Bugs in
CBMC's C-to-SMT translation could cause it to miss undefined behavior and to accept incorrect code; this has happened in
the past. However, CBMC is a mature, widely-used tool with an active community and extensive test suite, and
mlkem-native uses the latest CBMC version.

Also, the C language has many conformant implementations. For example, the width of pointer types could be
8/16/32/64-bit (or even larger on capability based architectures). CBMC models types and other implementation-defined
behavior (such as struct padding) following the host system's C compiler. At present, mlkem-native's CBMC proofs are
only run on 64-bit systems, and hence do not transfer to 16-bit or 32-bit systems. To mitigate this, the full functional
test suite (functional tests, KAT, ACVP, Wycheproof, unit tests) is run on a large variety of platforms and C compilers, covering 16-bit, 32-bit, and
64-bit C implementations. Moreover, mlkem-native uses fixed-width integer types (e.g. uint16_t) to reduce the risk of
semantic differences across compilers, and targets the initial C90 revision of C, which is expected to have more mature
compiler support and be less prone to modeling errors than newer language features.

Also, CBMC's memory model uses a flat, object-based representation with practically infinite space for local variables,
that is strictly more abstract than the target platform's memory layout. Concretely, for example, C imposes no limit on
the stack size (there is not even a notion of stack in C), but real systems do -- stack overflows are out of scope of
mlkem-native's CBMC proofs. To address this, mlkem-native's header provides constants for its memory usage that are
tested in CI to be accurate, reducing the risk of out-of-memory conditions such as stack overflows.

Finally, a compiler bug could lead to wrong object code being generated from correct C code, and proofs on outdated C
code could undermine the formal model. To guard against this, mlkem-native's CBMC proofs are run on every CI commit,
providing continuous regression testing and preventing proofs from getting out of date.

**Potential improvements.**
- Run CBMC proofs against 16-bit and 32-bit C compilers. ([#1192](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native/issues/1192))

## Gap C: Is the proof infrastructure sound?

There is risk that the formal statements made about the formal model are proved,
yet not true, because of an unsoundness in the underlying proof infrastructure.

### C1. HOL Light kernel and OCaml runtime

HOL Light has a small trusted kernel (~400 lines of OCaml) implementing 10 primitive inference rules and 3 axioms. All
proofs are ultimately constructed through this kernel. Higher level infrastructure such as proof automation cannot
compromise soundness as it is built atop the kernel. This is a fundamental design property of the LCF architecture.
No soundness bugs in the kernel have been found since 2003.

HOL Light runs on OCaml, so the OCaml compiler and runtime are also part of the trusted computing base. A compiler or
runtime bug could in principle allow construction of a spurious theorem. This is mitigated by OCaml's maturity and
widespread use.

Independent reassurance can be provided by Candle[^Candle] and HOLTrace [^HOLTrace]. See the s2n-bignum soundness doc[^s2n-bignum-soundness] for full details.

### C2. CBMC & SMT solver trusted computing base

The CBMC trusted computing base is substantially larger than HOL Light's:

- **CBMC itself**: The C frontend, GOTO program transformation, and SMT encoding are all
  part of the TCB. Unlike HOL Light's LCF architecture, there is no small kernel through
  which all results must pass. A bug anywhere in the CBMC pipeline could produce a false
  "verified" result.
- **SMT solvers** (Z3, Bitwuzla): These are complex software systems. A solver bug
  directly compromises soundness. Unlike HOL Light's LCF architecture, where bugs in
  proof automation cannot compromise soundness, a solver bug in CBMC's backend directly
  invalidates the proof.
- **The C compiler used by CBMC**: CBMC uses a C preprocessor and parser; bugs in these
  components could affect the analysis.

**Mitigations.**

- CBMC has been in development for more than 20 years and is widely used in industry (including
  at Amazon for AWS-LC and other projects).
- The SMT solvers are independently developed and extensively tested.
- mlkem-native's proofs are run continuously in CI, providing regression testing.

**Residual risks.** The CBMC TCB is orders of magnitude larger than HOL Light's. There is
no independent proof-checking mechanism analogous to Candle or HOLTrace. The soundness
guarantee for the C proofs is therefore fundamentally weaker than for the assembly proofs.

**Potential improvements**:
- Systematically introduce redundancy by employing more than one SMT solver backend
  for CBMC functions, or use solvers with independently checkable results ([#1603](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native/issues/1603)).
