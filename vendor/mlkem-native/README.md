mlkem-native is a secure, fast, and portable C90[^C90] implementation of ML-KEM[^FIPS203].
It is a fork of the ML-KEM reference implementation[^REF].

All C code in [mlkem/src/*](mlkem) and [mlkem/src/fips202/*](mlkem/src/fips202) is proved memory-safe (no memory overflow) and type-safe (no integer overflow)
using CBMC[^CBMC]. All AArch64 and x86_64 assembly is proved to be functionally correct,
memory-safe, and of secret-independent timing (constant-time), using HOL-Light[^HOL-Light].

mlkem-native includes native backends for Arm (64-bit, Neon), Intel/AMD (64-bit, AVX2), and RISC-V (64-bit, RVV). See [benchmarks](https://pq-code-package.github.io/mlkem-native/dev/bench/) for performance data.

mlkem-native is supported by the [Post-Quantum Cryptography Alliance](https://pqca.org/) as part of the [Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org/).

## Quickstart for Ubuntu

```bash
# Install base packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install make gcc python3 git

# Clone mlkem-native
git clone https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native.git
cd mlkem-native

# Build and run tests
make build
make test

# The same using `tests`, a convenience wrapper around `make`
./scripts/tests all
# Show all options
./scripts/tests --help
```

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for more information.

## Applications

mlkem-native is used in
 - [libOQS](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/) of the Open Quantum Safe project since [0.13.0](https://github.com/open-quantum-safe/liboqs/releases/tag/0.13.0) (as the default ML-KEM implementation)
 - AWS' Cryptography library [AWS-LC](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc/) since [v1.50.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc/releases/tag/v1.50.0)
 - The [rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls) TLS library written in Rust since [0.23.28](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/releases/tag/v%2F0.23.28) (through AWS-LC as the default cryptography provider)
 - The [zeroRISC's fork of OpenTitan](https://github.com/zerorisc/expo) - an open source silicon Root of Trust (RoT)

## Formal Verification

All C code in [mlkem/src/*](mlkem) and [mlkem/src/fips202/*](mlkem/src/fips202) is proved memory-safe (no memory overflow) and type-safe (no integer overflow).
This uses the [C Bounded Model Checker (CBMC)](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc) and builds on function contracts and loop invariant annotations
in the source code. See [proofs/cbmc](proofs/cbmc) for details.

All AArch64 and x86_64 assembly is proved functionally correct, memory-safe, and to have secret-independent timing
(constant-time), at the object-code level. This uses the [HOL-Light](https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light) interactive theorem prover and the
[s2n-bignum](https://github.com/awslabs/s2n-bignum/) verification infrastructure (which includes models of the
relevant parts of the Arm and x86 architectures). See [proofs/hol_light](proofs/hol_light) for details.

**NOTE:** Formal Verification is never absolute. See [SOUNDNESS.md](SOUNDNESS.md) for a detailed analysis of the scope, assumptions and risks of the formal verification
efforts around mlkem-native.

## Security

All AArch64 and x86_64 assembly in mlkem-native is formally proved in [HOL Light](https://github.com/jrh13/hol-light) to be free of secret-dependent control flow,
memory access patterns, and variable-latency instructions, thwarting most timing side channels
(see [proofs/hol_light](proofs/hol_light) for details). C code is hardened against
compiler-introduced timing side channels (such as KyberSlash[^KyberSlash] or clangover[^clangover])
through suitable barriers and constant-time patterns.

Absence of secret-dependent branches, memory-access patterns and variable-latency instructions is also tested using `valgrind`
with various combinations of compilers and compilation options.

## Design

mlkem-native is split into a _frontend_ and two _backends_ for arithmetic and FIPS202 / SHA3. The frontend is
fixed, written in C, and covers all routines that are not critical to performance. The backends are flexible, take care of
performance-sensitive routines, and can be implemented in C or native code (assembly/intrinsics); see
[mlkem/src/native/api.h](mlkem/src/native/api.h) for the arithmetic backend and
[mlkem/src/fips202/native/api.h](mlkem/src/fips202/native/api.h) for the FIPS-202 backend.

mlkem-native currently offers the following backends:

* Default portable C backend
* 64-bit Arm backend (using Neon)
* 64-bit Intel/AMD backend (using AVX2)
* 64-bit RISC-V backend (using RVV)
* 32-bit Armv8.1-M backend (using Helium/MVE) -- see [#1501](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native/issues/1501). This is still experimental and disabled by default.

If you'd like contribute new backends, please reach out or just open a PR.

Our AArch64 assembly is developed using the [SLOTHY](https://github.com/slothy-optimizer/slothy) superoptimizer, following the approach described in the SLOTHY paper[^SLOTHY_Paper]:
We write 'clean' assembly by hand and automate micro-optimizations (e.g. see the [clean](dev/aarch64_clean/src/ntt.S) vs [optimized](dev/aarch64_opt/src/ntt.S) AArch64 NTT).
See [dev/README.md](dev/README.md) for more details.

## Test Vectors

mlkem-native is tested against all official ACVP ML-KEM test vectors[^ACVP] and the
Wycheproof[^wycheproof] ML-KEM test vectors.

### ACVP

You can run ACVP tests using the [`tests`](./scripts/tests) script or the [ACVP client](./test/acvp/acvp_client.py) directly:

```bash
# Using the tests script
./scripts/tests acvp
# Using a specific ACVP release
./scripts/tests acvp --version v1.1.0.41

# Using the ACVP client directly
python3 ./test/acvp/acvp_client.py
python3 ./test/acvp/acvp_client.py --version v1.1.0.41

# Using specific ACVP test vector files (downloaded from the ACVP-Server)
# python3 ./test/acvp/acvp_client.py -p {PROMPT}.json -e {EXPECTED_RESULT}.json
# For example, assuming you have run the above
python3 ./test/acvp/acvp_client.py \
  -p ./test/acvp/.acvp-data/v1.1.0.41/files/ML-KEM-keyGen-FIPS203/prompt.json \
  -e ./test/acvp/.acvp-data/v1.1.0.41/files/ML-KEM-keyGen-FIPS203/expectedResults.json
```

### Wycheproof

You can run Wycheproof[^wycheproof] tests using the [`tests`](./scripts/tests) script or the [Wycheproof client](./test/wycheproof/wycheproof_client.py) directly:

```bash
# Using the tests script
./scripts/tests wycheproof

# Using the Wycheproof client directly
python3 ./test/wycheproof/wycheproof_client.py
```

## Benchmarking

You can measure performance, memory usage, and binary size using the [`tests`](./scripts/tests) script:

```bash
# Speed benchmarks (-c selects cycle counter: NO, PMU, PERF, or MAC)
# Note: PERF/MAC may require the -r flag to run benchmarking binaries using sudo
./scripts/tests bench -c PMU
./scripts/tests bench -c PERF -r

# Stack usage analysis
./scripts/tests stack

# Binary size measurement
./scripts/tests size
```

For CI benchmark results and historical performance data, see the [benchmarking page](https://pq-code-package.github.io/mlkem-native/dev/bench/).

## Usage

If you want to use mlkem-native, import [mlkem](mlkem) into your project's source tree and build using your favourite build system. See [mlkem](mlkem) for more information, and
[examples/basic](examples/basic) for a simple example. The build system provided in this repository is for development purposes only.

### Can I bring my own FIPS-202?

mlkem-native relies on and comes with an implementation of FIPS-202[^FIPS202]. If your library has its own FIPS-202 implementation, you
can use it instead of the one shipped with mlkem-native. See [FIPS202.md](FIPS202.md), and [examples/bring_your_own_fips202](examples/bring_your_own_fips202)
for an example using tiny_sha3[^tiny_sha3].

### Do I need to use the assembly backends?

No. If you want a C-only build, just omit the directories [mlkem/src/native](mlkem/src/native) and/or [mlkem/src/fips202/native](mlkem/src/fips202/native) from your import
and unset `MLK_CONFIG_USE_NATIVE_BACKEND_ARITH` and/or `MLK_CONFIG_USE_NATIVE_BACKEND_FIPS202` in your [mlkem_native_config.h](mlkem/mlkem_native_config.h).

### Do I need to setup CBMC to use mlkem-native?

No. While we recommend that you consider using it, mlkem-native will build + run fine without CBMC -- just make sure to
include [cbmc.h](mlkem/src/cbmc.h) and have `CBMC` undefined. In particular, you do _not_ need to remove all function
contracts and loop invariants from the code; they will be ignored unless `CBMC` is set.

### Does mlkem-native support all security levels of ML-KEM?

Yes. The security level is a compile-time parameter configured by setting `MLK_CONFIG_PARAMETER_SET=512/768/1024` in [mlkem_native_config.h](mlkem/mlkem_native_config.h).
If your library/application requires multiple security levels, you can build + link three instances of mlkem-native
while sharing common code; this is called a 'multi-level build' and is demonstrated in [examples/multilevel_build](examples/multilevel_build). See also [mlkem](mlkem).

### Can I bring my own backend?

Yes, you can add further backends for ML-KEM native arithmetic and/or for FIPS-202. Follow the existing backends
as templates or see [examples/custom_backend](examples/custom_backend) for a minimal example how to register a custom backend.
