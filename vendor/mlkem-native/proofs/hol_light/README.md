# HOL Light proofs

This directory contains proofs for all AArch64 and x86_64 assembly in mlkem-native.
They are written in the [HOL Light](https://hol-light.github.io/) theorem prover, utilizing the assembly verification
infrastructure from [s2n-bignum](https://github.com/awslabs/s2n-bignum).

The proofs cover three properties:
- **Functional correctness:** The assembly computes the right answer.
- **Memory safety:** The assembly only accesses memory within the bounds of what is provided or allocated.
- **Secret-independent timing (constant-time):** The assembly is free of secret-dependent control flow, memory access patterns, and variable-latency instructions.

The one exception is rejection sampling (`mlkem_rej_uniform`), which only has a functional correctness specification.
Rejection sampling is safely variable-time, so no constant-time proof is needed. Memory safety proofs for rejection
sampling are not yet available ([#1596](https://github.com/pq-code-package/mlkem-native/issues/1596)).

See [SOUNDNESS.md](../../SOUNDNESS.md) for a detailed analysis of the scope, assumptions and risks of the formal verification efforts.

Each function is proved in a separate `.ml` file in [aarch64/proofs/](aarch64/proofs) and [x86_64/proofs/](x86_64/proofs). Each file
contains the byte code being verified, as well as the specification that is being proved.

## Primer

Proofs are 'post-hoc' in the sense that HOL-Light/s2n-bignum operate on the final object code. In particular, the means by which the code was generated (including the [SLOTHY](https://github.com/slothy-optimizer/slothy/) superoptimizer) need not be trusted.

Specifications are essentially [Hoare triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic), with the noteworthy difference that the program is implicit as the content of memory at the PC; which is asserted to
be the code under verification as part of the precondition. For example, the following is the specification of the aarch64 `poly_reduce` function:

```ocaml
 (* For all (abbreviated by `!` in HOL):
    - a: Source pointer
    - pc: Current value of Program Counter (PC)
    - returnaddress: Return address in the link register *)
`!a x pc returnaddress.
    (* Assume that the program and the source pointer don't overlap *)
    nonoverlapping (word pc,0x124) (a,512)
    ==> ensures arm
      (* Precondition *)
      (\s. (* The memory at the current PC is the byte-code of poly_reduce() *)
        aligned_bytes_loaded s (word pc) mlkem_poly_reduce_mc /\
        read PC s = word pc /\
        (* The return address is stored in the link register (LR) *)
        read X30 s = returnaddress /\
        (* The source pointer is in X0 *)
        C_ARGUMENTS [a] s /\
        (* Give a name to the memory contents at the source pointer *)
        !i. i < 256
            ==> read(memory :> bytes16(word_add a (word(2 * i)))) s = x i)
      (* Postcondition: Eventually we reach a state where ... *)
      (\s.
        (* The PC is the original value of the link register *)
        read PC s = returnaddress /\
        (* The integers represented by the final memory contents
         * are the unsigned canonical reductions mod 3329
         * of the integers represented by the original memory contents. *)
        !i. i < 256
            ==> ival(read(memory :> bytes16 (word_add a (word(2 * i)))) s) =
                ival(x i) rem &3329)
      (* Footprint: The program may modify (only) the ABI permitted registers
       * and flags, and the memory contents at the source pointer. *)
      (MAYCHANGE_REGS_AND_FLAGS_PERMITTED_BY_ABI ,,
       MAYCHANGE [memory :> bytes(a,512)])`
```

## Secret-independent timing

The s2n-bignum formal model introduces the notion of *microarchitectural events* — flagging instructions that are
known to exhibit variable timing or influence timing otherwise (e.g., through caches). Examples are branches,
load/store instructions, or variable-time instructions such as divisions. The constant-time specifications then
posit that the trace of microarchitectural events emitted by a program can be expressed as a function of public
variables such as input/output pointers or pointers to constant tables. Conversely, and somewhat implicitly, the
absence of the (possibly secret) _data_ behind those pointers as a parameter to the event-generating function
implies that there are no secret-dependent branches, load/stores, etc.

This formal notion does not and cannot guarantee that the hardware executes instructions in constant time:
unmodeled microarchitectural effects such as speculative execution or Hertzbleed-style frequency scaling can still
leak information. See [SOUNDNESS.md](../../SOUNDNESS.md) for a full discussion of the scope, assumptions, and
limitations.

## Reproducing the proofs

To reproduce the proofs, enter the nix shell via

```bash
nix develop --experimental-features 'nix-command flakes'
```

from mlkem-native's base directory. Then

```bash
make -C proofs/hol_light/aarch64
```
or

```bash
make -C proofs/hol_light/x86_64
```

will build and run the proofs. Note that this make take hours even on powerful machines.

For convenience, you can also use `tests hol_light` which wraps the `make` invocation above; see `tests hol_light --help`.

## Interactive proof development

For interactive proof development, start the HOL Light server:

```bash
hol-server [port]  # default port is 2012
```

Then use the [HOL Light extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=monadius.hol-light-simple)
to connect and send commands interactively.

Alternatively, send commands using netcat:

```bash
echo '1+1;;' | nc -w 5 127.0.0.1 2012
```
