These are the current requirements for getting your code included in RF24:

* Try your best to follow the rest of the code, if you're unsure then the NASA C style can help as it's closest to the current style: https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19950022400.pdf

* Definetly follow [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) if it's Python code.

* Follow the [Arduino IDE formatting style](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/StyleGuide) for Arduino examples

* Add [doxygen-compatible documentation](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html) to any new functions you add, or update existing documentation if you change behaviour
