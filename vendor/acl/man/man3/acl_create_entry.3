.Dt ACL_CREATE_ENTRY 3
.Os "Linux ACL"
.Sh NAME
.Nm acl_create_entry
.Nd create a new ACL entry
.Sh LIBRARY
Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, \-lacl).
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/acl.h
.Ft int
.Fn acl_create_entry "acl_t *acl_p" "acl_entry_t *entry_p"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acl_create_entry
function creates a new ACL entry in the ACL pointed to by the contents of the pointer argument
.Va acl_p .
On success, the function returns a descriptor for the new
ACL entry via
.Va entry_p .
.Pp
This function may cause memory to be allocated.  The caller should free any
releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by calling
.Xr acl_free 3
with
.\" <AG>
.\" 1003.1e says:
.\" .Va (void*)acl_t
.\" this makes no sense, so:
.Va (void*)*acl_p
.\" </AG>
as an argument.
If the ACL working storage cannot be increased in the current location,
then the working storage for the ACL pointed to by
.Va acl_p
may be relocated and the previous working storage is released. A pointer to
the new working storage is returned via
.Va acl_p .
.Pp
The components of the new ACL entry are initialized in the following ways: the
ACL tag type component contains ACL_UNDEFINED_TAG, the qualifier component
contains ACL_UNDEFINED_ID, and the set of permissions has no permissions
enabled. Any existing ACL entry descriptors that refer to entries in the ACL
continue to refer to those entries.
.\" <AG>
.\" Conflict between requirements:
.\" (a) ACL may be relocated,
.\" (b) all pointers remain valid.
.\" </AG>
.Sh RETURN VALUE
.Rv -std acl_create_entry
.Sh ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, the
.Fn acl_create_entry
function returns
.Li -1
and sets
.Va errno
to the corresponding value:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The argument
.Va acl_p
is not a valid pointer to an ACL.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
The ACL working storage requires more memory than is allowed by the hardware or system-imposed memory management constraints.
