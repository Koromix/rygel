.Dt ACL_FROM_TEXT 3
.Os "Linux ACL"
.Sh NAME
.Nm acl_to_text
.Nd convert an ACL to text
.Sh LIBRARY
Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, \-lacl).
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/acl.h
.Ft char *
.Fn acl_to_text "acl_t acl" "ssize_t *len_p"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acl_to_text
function translates the ACL pointed to by the argument
.Va acl
into a
.Li NULL
terminated character string.  If the pointer
.Va len_p
is not
.Li NULL ,
then the function returns the length of the string (not
including the
.Li NULL
terminator) in the location pointed to by
.Va len_p .
The format of the text string returned by
.Fn acl_to_text
is the long text form defined in
.Xr acl 5 .
The ACL referred to by
.Va acl
is not changed.
.Pp
This function allocates any memory necessary to contain the string and
returns a pointer to the string.  The caller should free any releasable
memory, when the new string is no longer required, by calling
.Xr acl_free 3
with the
.Va (void*)char
returned by
.Fn acl_to_text
as an argument.
.Sh RETURN VALUE
On success, this function returns a pointer to the
long text form of the ACL.
On error, a value of
.Li (char *)NULL
is returned, and
.Va errno
is set appropriately.
.Sh ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, the
.Fn acl_to_text
function returns a value of
.Li (char *)NULL
and sets
.Va errno
to the corresponding value:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The argument
.Va acl
is not a valid pointer to an ACL.
.Pp
The ACL referenced by
.Va acl
contains one or more improperly formed ACL entries, or for some other
reason cannot be translated into a text form of an ACL.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
The character string to be returned requires more memory than is allowed
by the hardware or system-imposed memory management constraints.
