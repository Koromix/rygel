.Dt ACL_INIT 3
.Os "Linux ACL"
.Sh NAME
.Nm acl_init
.Nd initialize ACL working storage
.Sh LIBRARY
Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, \-lacl).
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/acl.h
.Ft acl_t
.Fn acl_init "int count"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acl_init
function allocates and initializes the working storage for an ACL of at least
.Va count
ACL entries.  The ACL created initially contains no ACL entries.
A pointer to the working storage is returned.
.Pp
This function may cause memory to be allocated.  The caller should free any
releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by calling
.Xr acl_free 3
with the
.Va (void*)acl_t
returned by
.Fn acl_init
as an argument.
.Sh RETURN VALUE
On success, this function returns a pointer to the
working storage.  On error, a value of
.Li (acl_t)NULL
is returned, and
.Va errno
is set appropriately.
.Sh ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, the
.Fn acl_init
function returns a value of
.Li (acl_t)NULL
and sets
.Va errno
to the corresponding value:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The value of count is less than zero.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
The
.Va acl_t
to be returned requires more memory than is allowed by the hardware or
system-imposed memory management constraints.
.El
.Sh STANDARDS
IEEE Std 1003.1e draft 17 (\(lqPOSIX.1e\(rq, abandoned)
