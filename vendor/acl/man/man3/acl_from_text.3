.Dt ACL_FROM_TEXT 3
.Os "Linux ACL"
.Sh NAME
.Nm acl_from_text
.Nd create an ACL from text
.Sh LIBRARY
Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, \-lacl).
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/acl.h
.Ft acl_t
.Fn acl_from_text "const char *buf_p"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acl_from_text
function converts the text form of the ACL referred to by
.Va buf_p
into the internal form of an ACL and returns a pointer to the working storage
that contains the ACL. The
.Fn acl_from_text
function accepts as input the long text form and short text form of an ACL as described in
.Xr acl 5 .
.Pp
This function may cause memory to be allocated.  The caller should free any
releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by calling
.Xr acl_free 3
with the
.Va (void*)acl_t
returned by
.Fn acl_from_text
as an argument.
.Sh RETURN VALUE
On success, this function returns a pointer to the
working storage.  On error, a value of
.Li (acl_t)NULL
is returned, and
.Va errno
is set appropriately.
.Sh ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, the
.Fn acl_from_text
function returns a value of
.Li (acl_t)NULL
and sets
.Va errno
to the corresponding value:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The argument
.Va buf_p
cannot be translated into an ACL.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
The
.Va acl_t
to be returned requires more memory than is allowed by the hardware or
system-imposed memory management constraints.
