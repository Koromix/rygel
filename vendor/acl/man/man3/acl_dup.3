.Dt ACL_DUP 3
.Os "Linux ACL"
.Sh NAME
.Nm acl_dup
.Nd duplicate an ACL
.Sh LIBRARY
Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, \-lacl).
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/acl.h
.Ft acl_t
.Fn acl_dup "acl_t acl"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acl_dup
function returns a pointer to a copy of the ACL pointed to by
.Va acl .
.Pp
This function may cause memory to be allocated.  The caller should free any
releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by calling
.Xr acl_free 3
with the
.Va (void*)acl_t
returned by
.Fn acl_dup
as an argument.
.Sh RETURN VALUE
On success, this function returns a pointer to the
working storage.  On error, a value of
.Li (acl_t)NULL
is returned, and
.Va errno
is set appropriately.
.Sh ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, the
.Fn acl_dup
function returns a value of
.Li (acl_t)NULL
and sets
.Va errno
to the corresponding value:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The argument
.Va acl
is not a valid pointer to an ACL.
.It Bq Er ENOMEM
The
.Va acl_t
to be returned requires more memory than is allowed by the hardware or
system-imposed memory management constraints.
