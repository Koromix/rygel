.Dt ACL_COPY_EXT 3
.Os "Linux ACL"
.Sh NAME
.Nm acl_copy_ext
.Nd copy an ACL from internal to external representation
.Sh LIBRARY
Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, \-lacl).
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In sys/types.h
.In sys/acl.h
.Ft ssize_t
.Fn acl_copy_ext "void *buf_p" "acl_t acl" "ssize_t size"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn acl_copy_ext
function copies the ACL pointed to by
.Va acl
from system-managed space to the user managed space pointed to by
.Va buf_p .
The
.Va size
parameter represents the size in bytes of the buffer pointed to by
.Va buf_p .
The format of the ACL placed in the buffer pointed to by
.Va buf_p
is a contiguous, persistent data item, the format of which is unspecified.
It is the responsibility of the invoker to allocate an area large enough
to hold the copied ACL. The size of the exportable, contiguous, persistent
form of the ACL may be obtained by invoking the
.Fn acl_size
function.
.Pp
Any ACL entry descriptors that refer to an entry in the ACL referenced by
.Va acl
continue to refer to those entries. Any existing ACL pointers that refer
to the ACL referenced by
.Va acl
continue to refer to the ACL.
.Sh RETURN VALUE
Upon success, this function returns the number of bytes placed in the buffer pointed to by
.Va buf_p .
On error, a value of
.Li (ssize_t)-1
is returned and
.Va errno
is set appropriately.
.Sh ERRORS
If any of the following conditions occur, the
.Fn acl_copy_ext
function returns a value of
.Li (ssize_t)-1
and sets
.Va errno
to the corresponding value:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The
.Va size
parameter is zero or negative.
.Pp
The argument
.Va acl
is not a valid pointer to an ACL.
.Pp
The ACL referenced by
.Va acl
contains one or more improperly formed ACL entries, or for some other
reason cannot be translated into the external form of an ACL.
.It Bq Er ERANGE
The
.Va size
parameter is greater than zero but smaller than the length of the contiguous, persistent form of the ACL.
