.TH SETFACL 1 "ACL File Utilities" "May 2000" "Access Control Lists"
.SH NAME
setfacl \- set file access control lists
.SH SYNOPSIS

.B setfacl
[\-bkndRLPvh] [{\-m|\-x} acl_spec] [{\-M|\-X} acl_file] file ...

.B setfacl
\-\-restore={file|-}

.SH DESCRIPTION
This utility sets Access Control Lists (ACLs) of files and directories.
On the command line, a sequence of commands is followed by a sequence of
files (which in turn can be followed by another sequence of commands, ...).

The
.I \-m
and
.I \-x
options expect an ACL on the command line. Multiple ACL entries are separated
by comma characters (`,'). The
.I \-M
and
.I \-X
options read an ACL from a file or from standard input. The ACL entry format is
described in Section ACL ENTRIES.

The
.IR "\-\-set" " and " "\-\-set-file"
options set the ACL of a file or a directory. The previous ACL is
replaced.
ACL entries for this operation must include permissions.

The
.IR "\-m (\-\-modify)" " and " "\-M (\-\-modify-file)"
options modify the ACL of a file or directory.
ACL entries for this operation must include permissions.

The
.IR "\-x (\-\-remove)" " and " "\-X (\-\-remove-file)"
options remove ACL entries. It is not an error to remove an entry which
does not exist.  Only ACL entries without the
.I perms
field are accepted as parameters, unless POSIXLY_CORRECT is defined.

When reading from files using the 
.I \-M
and
.IR \-X
options, setfacl accepts the output getfacl produces.
There is at most one ACL entry per line. After a Pound sign (`#'),
everything up to the end of the line is treated as a comment.

If setfacl is used on a file system which does not support ACLs, setfacl
operates on the file mode permission bits. If the ACL does not fit completely
in the permission bits, setfacl modifies the file mode permission bits to reflect the ACL as closely as possible, writes an error message to standard error, and returns with an exit status greater than 0.

.SS PERMISSIONS
The file owner and processes capable of CAP_FOWNER are granted the right
to modify ACLs of a file. This is analogous to the permissions required
for accessing the file mode. (On current Linux systems, root is the only
user with the CAP_FOWNER capability.)

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 4
.I \-b, \-\-remove-all
Remove all extended ACL entries. The base ACL entries of the owner, group and others are retained.
.TP 4
.I \-k, \-\-remove-default
Remove the Default ACL. If no Default ACL exists, no warnings are issued.
.TP 4
.I \-n, \-\-no-mask
Do not recalculate the effective rights mask. The default behavior of
setfacl is to recalculate the ACL mask entry, unless a mask entry was explicitly given.
The mask entry is set to the union of all permissions of the owning group, and all named user and group entries. (These are exactly the entries affected by the mask entry).
.TP 4
.I \-\-mask
Do recalculate the effective rights mask, even if an ACL mask entry was explicitly given. (See the
.IR "\-n " option.)
.TP 4
.I \-d, \-\-default
All operations apply to the Default ACL. Regular ACL entries in the
input set are promoted to Default ACL entries. Default ACL entries in
the input set are discarded. (A warning is issued if that happens).
.TP 4
.I \-\-restore={file|-}
Restore a permission backup created by `getfacl \-R' or similar. All permissions
of a complete directory subtree are restored using this mechanism. If the input
contains owner comments or group comments, setfacl attempts to restore the
owner and owning group. If the input contains flags comments (which define the setuid,
setgid, and sticky bits), setfacl sets those three bits accordingly; otherwise,
it clears them. This option cannot be mixed with other options except `\-\-test'.
If the file specified is '\fB-\fP', then it will be read from standard input.
.TP 4
.I \-\-test
Test mode. Instead of changing the ACLs of any files, the resulting ACLs are listed.
.TP 4
.I \-R, \-\-recursive
Apply operations to all files and directories recursively. This option cannot be mixed with `\-\-restore'.
.TP 4
.I \-L, \-\-logical
Logical walk, follow symbolic links to directories. The default behavior is to follow
symbolic link arguments, and skip symbolic links encountered in subdirectories.
Only effective in combination with \-R.
This option cannot be mixed with `\-\-restore'.
.TP 4
.I \-P, \-\-physical
Physical walk, do not follow symbolic links to directories.
This also skips symbolic link arguments.
Only effective in combination with \-R.
This option cannot be mixed with `\-\-restore'.
.TP 4
.I \-v, \-\-version
Print the version of setfacl and exit.
.TP 4
.I \-h, \-\-help
Print help explaining the command line options.
.TP 4
.I \-\-
End of command line options. All remaining parameters are interpreted as file names, even if they start with a dash.
.TP 4
.I \-
If the file name parameter is a single dash, setfacl reads a list of files from standard input.

.SS ACL ENTRIES
The setfacl utility recognizes the following ACL entry formats (blanks
inserted for clarity):

.fam C
.TP
.RI "[d[efault]:] [u[ser]:]" "uid " [: perms ]
.fam T
Permissions of a named user. Permissions of the file owner if
.I uid
is empty.
.fam C
.TP
.RI "[d[efault]:] g[roup]:" "gid " [: perms ]
.fam T
Permissions of a named group. Permissions of the owning group if
.I gid
is empty.
.fam C
.TP
.RI "[d[efault]:] m[ask][:] [:" perms ]
.fam T
Effective rights mask
.fam C
.TP
.RI "[d[efault]:] o[ther][:] [:" perms ]
.fam T
Permissions of others.
.PP
Whitespace between delimiter characters and non-delimiter characters is ignored.
.PP
.PP
Proper ACL entries including permissions are used in modify and set operations. (options
.IR \-m ", " \-M ", " \-\-set " and " \-\-set-file ).
Entries without the
.I perms
field are used for
.I deletion
of entries (options
.IR \-x " and " \-X ).
.PP
For
.I uid
and
.I gid
you can specify either a name or a number.  Character literals may be specified
with a backslash followed by the 3-digit octal digits corresponding to the
ASCII code for the character (e.g.,
.I \e101
for 'A').  If the name contains a literal backslash followed by 3 digits, the
backslash must be escaped (i.e.,
.IR "\e\e" ).
.PP
The
.I perms
field is a combination of characters that indicate the read
.IR (r) ,
write
.IR (w) ,
execute
.IR (x)
permissions.  Dash characters in the
.I perms
field
.IR (\-)
are ignored.  The character
.I X
stands for the execute permission if the file is a directory or already has
execute permission for some user.  Alternatively, the
.I perms
field can define the permissions numerically, as a bit-wise combination of read
.IR (4) ,
write
.IR (2) ,
and execute
.IR (1) .
Zero
.I perms
fields or
.I perms
fields that only consist of dashes indicate no permissions.
.PP
.SS AUTOMATICALLY CREATED ENTRIES
Initially, files and directories contain only the three base ACL entries
for the owner, the group, and others. There are some rules that
need to be satisfied in order for an ACL to be valid:
.IP * 4
The three base entries cannot be removed. There must be exactly one
entry of each of these base entry types.
.IP * 4
Whenever an ACL contains named user entries or named group objects,
it must also contain an effective rights mask.
.IP * 4
Whenever an ACL contains any Default ACL entries, the three Default ACL
base entries (default owner, default group, and default others) must also exist.
.IP * 4
Whenever a Default ACL contains named user entries or named group objects,
it must also contain a default effective rights mask.
.PP
To help the user ensure these rules, setfacl creates entries from existing
entries under the following conditions:
.IP * 4
If an ACL contains named user or named group entries, and
no mask entry exists, a mask entry containing the same permissions as
the group entry is created. Unless the
.I \-n
option is given, the permissions of the mask entry are further adjusted to include the union of all permissions affected by the mask entry. (See the
.I \-n
option description).
.IP * 4
If a Default ACL entry is created, and the Default ACL contains no
owner, owning group, or others entry, a copy of the ACL owner, owning group, or others entry is added to the Default ACL.
.IP * 4
If a Default ACL contains named user entries or named group entries, and no mask entry exists, a mask entry containing the same permissions as the default Default ACL's group entry is added. Unless the
.I \-n
option is given, the permissions of the mask entry are further adjusted to
include the union of all permissions affected by the mask entry. (See the
.I \-n
option description).

If the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is defined, the default behavior of setfacl changes as follows: All non-standard options are disabled.
The ``default:'' prefix is disabled.
The
.IR \-x " and " \-X
options also accept permission fields (and ignore them).
