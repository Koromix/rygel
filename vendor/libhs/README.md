libhs
=====

libhs is a C library to enumerate HID and serial devices and interact with them. It is:
- **cross-platform**: supports Windows (Vista or more), Linux and Mac OS X.
- **driverless**: uses native OS-provided interfaces and does not require custom drivers.

You can download the library in the [release section](https://github.com/Koromix/libhs/releases).
Pre-built binaries are available for Windows (MSVC 2015 and MinGW-w64) and Mac OS X (Clang).

Refer to the [Doxygen documentation](https://koromix.github.io/libhs) for more information.
