  ntlm: fix negotiated flags usage
  
  According to Microsoft document MS-NLMP, current flags usage is not
  accurate: flag NTLMFLAG_NEGOTIATE_NTLM2_KEY controls the use of
  extended security in an NTLM authentication message and NTLM version 2
  cannot be negotiated within the protocol.
  
  The solution implemented here is: if the extended security flag is set,
  prefer using NTLM version 2 (as a server featuring extended security
  should also support version 2). If version 2 has been disabled at
  compile time, use extended security.
  
  Tests involving NTLM are adjusted to this new behavior.

- [Michael Forney brought this change]

  configure: include <time.h> unconditionally
  
  In 2682e5f5, several instances of AC_HEADER_TIME were removed since
  it is a deprecated autoconf macro. However, this was the macro that
  defined TIME_WITH_SYS_TIME, which was used to indicate that <time.h>
  can be included alongside <sys/time.h>. TIME_WITH_SYS_TIME is still
  used in the configure test body and since it is no longer defined,
  <time.h> is *not* included on systems that have <sys/time.h>.
  
  In particular, at least on musl libc and glibc, <sys/time.h> does
  not implicitly include <time.h> and does not declare clock_gettime,
  gmtime_r, or localtime_r. This causes configure to fail to detect
  those functions.
  
  The AC_HEADER_TIME macro deprecation text says
  
  > All current systems provide time.h; it need not be checked for.
  > Not all systems provide sys/time.h, but those that do, all allow
  > you to include it and time.h simultaneously.
  
  So, to fix this issue, simply include <time.h> unconditionally when
  testing for time-related functions and in libcurl, and don't bother
  checking for it.
  
  Closes #6859

- [Michael Forney brought this change]

  configure: remove use of RETSIGTYPE
  
  This was previously defined by the obsolete AC_TYPE_SIGNAL macro,
  which was removed in 2682e5f5. The deprecation text says
  
  > Your code may safely assume C89 semantics that RETSIGTYPE is void.
  
  So, remove it and just use void instead.

  tool_progress: Fix progress meter in parallel mode
  
  Make sure the total amount of DL/UL bytes are counted before the
  transfer finalizes. Otherwise if a transfer finishes too quick, its
  total numbers are not added, and results in a DL%/UL% that goes above
  100%.
  
  Detail:
  
  progress_meter() is called periodically, and it may not catch a
  transfer's total bytes if the value was unknown during the last call,
  and the transfer is finished and deleted (i.e., lost) during the next
  call.

  file: support GETing directories again
  
  After 957bc1881e686f9714c4e6a01bf33535091f0e21, we no longer compute an
  expected_size for directories. This has the upshot that when we compare
  even an empty Range with the available size, we fail.
  
  This brings back the previous behaviour, which was to succeed, but with
  empty content. This also removes the "Accept-ranges: bytes" header,
  which is nonsensical on directories.

  Prior to this change building curl without an asynchronous resolver
  backend (c-ares or threaded) and without DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS, which is
  also asynchronous but independent of resolver backend) would cause a
  build error since Curl_resolver_error is called by and evaluates

  acknowledge whichever timeout that is reached first.
  
  This is especially notable when a transfer first sits in PENDING, as
  that time is counted in the total time but the connect timeout is based
  on the time since the handle changed to the CONNECT state.
  
  The CONNECTTIMEOUT is per connect attempt. The TIMEOUT is for the entire

  to only use data where it's checked for being a NULL pointer.  The libpsl
  support code does however dereference data without checking, so if we are
  indeed having an unset data pointer we cannot PSL check the cookiedomain.
  
  This is currently not a reachable dereference, as the only caller with a
  NULL data isn't passing a file to initialize cookies from, but since the
  API has this contract let's ensure we hold it.

- schannel: Evaluate CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS via SSL_SET_OPTION macro
  
  - Change use of those options from CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS that are not
    already evaluated via SSL_SET_OPTION in schannel and secure transport
    to use that instead of data->set.ssl.optname.
  
  Example:
  
  Evaluate SSL_SET_OPTION(no_revoke) instead of data->set.ssl.no_revoke.
  
  This change is because options set via CURLOPT_SSL_OPTIONS
  (data->set.ssl.optname) are separate from those set for HTTPS proxy via
  CURLOPT_PROXY_SSL_OPTIONS (data->set.proxy_ssl.optname). The
  SSL_SET_OPTION macro determines whether the connection is for HTTPS
  proxy and based on that which option to evaluate.

  HTTPS proxy in libcurl, this change is for posterity and has no other
  effect.

- projects: Update VS projects for OpenSSL 1.1.x
  
  - Update VS project templates to use the OpenSSL lib names and include
    directories for OpenSSL 1.1.x.
  
  This change means the VS project files will now build only with OpenSSL
  1.1.x when an OpenSSL configuration is chosen. Prior to this change the
  project files built only with OpenSSL 1.0.x (end-of-life) when an
  OpenSSL configuration was chosen.
  
  The template changes in this commit were made by script:
  
  libeay32.lib => libcrypto.lib
  ssleay32.lib => libssl.lib
  ..\..\..\..\..\openssl\inc32 => ..\..\..\..\..\openssl\include
  
  And since the output directory now contains the includes it's prepended:
  ..\..\..\..\..\openssl\build\Win{32,64}\VC{6..15}\{DLL,LIB}
  {Debug,Release}\include
  
  - Change build-openssl.bat to copy the build's include directory to the
    output directory (as seen above).
  
  Each build has its own opensslconf.h which is different so we can't just
  include the source include directory any longer.
  
  Note the include directory in the output directory is a full copy from
  the build so technically we don't need to include the OpenSSL source
  include directory in the template. However, I left it last in case the
  user made a custom OpenSSL build using the old method which would put
  opensslconf in the OpenSSL source include directory.
  
  - Change build-openssl.bat to use a temporary install directory that is
    different from the temporary build directory.
  
  For OpenSSL 1.1.x the temporary paths must be separate not a descendant
  of the other, otherwise pdb files will be lost between builds.

- memdebug: close debug logfile explicitly on exit
  
  - Use atexit to register a dbg cleanup function that closes the logfile.
  
  LeakSantizier (LSAN) calls _exit() instead of exit() when a leak is
  detected on exit so the logfile must be closed explicitly or data could
  be lost. Though _exit() does not call atexit handlers such as this,
  LSAN's call to _exit() comes after the atexit handlers are called.
  
  Prior to this change the logfile was not explicitly closed so it was
  possible that if LSAN detected a leak and called _exit (which does
  not flush or close files like exit) then the logfile could be missing
  data. That could then cause curl's memanalyze to report false leaks
  (eg a malloc was recorded to the logfile but the corresponding free was
  discarded from the buffer instead of written to the logfile, then
  memanalyze reports that as a leak).

- curl_multibyte: always return a heap-allocated copy of string
  
  - Change the Windows char <-> UTF-8 conversion functions to return an

  Prior to this change the curlx_convert_ functions would, as what I
  assume was an optimization, not make a copy of the passed in string if
  no conversion was required. No conversion is required in non-UNICODE
  Windows builds since our tchar strings are type char and remain in
  whatever the passed in encoding is, which is assumed to be UTF-8 but may
  be other encoding.
  
  In contrast the UNICODE Windows builds require conversion
  (wchar <-> char) and do return a copy. That inconsistency could lead to
  programming errors where the developer expects a copy, and does not
  realize that won't happen in all cases.

  references to conn->data.
  
  Closes #6608

- doh: Fix sharing user's resolve list with DOH handles
  
  - Share the shared object from the user's easy handle with the DOH
    handles.
  
  Prior to this change if the user had set a shared object with shared
  cached DNS (CURL_LOCK_DATA_DNS) for their easy handle then that wasn't
  used by any associated DOH handles, since they used the multi's default
  hostcache.
  
  This change means all the handles now use the same hostcache, which is
  either the shared hostcache from the user created shared object if it
  exists or if not then the multi's default hostcache.

- http2: remove conn->data use
  
  ... but instead use a private alternative that points to the "driving
  transfer" from the connection. We set the "user data" associated with
  the connection to be the connectdata struct, but when we drive transfers
  the code still needs to know the pointer to the transfer. We can change
  the user data to become the Curl_easy handle, but with older nghttp2
  version we cannot dynamically update that pointer properly when
  different transfers are used over the same connection.
  
  Closes #6520

- openssl: remove conn->data use
  
  We still make the trace callback function get the connectdata struct
  passed to it, since the callback is anchored on the connection.
  
  Repeatedly updating the callback pointer to set 'data' with
  SSL_CTX_set_msg_callback_arg() doesn't seem to work, probably because
  there might already be messages in the queue with the old pointer.
  
  This code therefore makes sure to set the "logger" handle before using
  OpenSSL calls so that the right easy handle gets used for tracing.

- doh: add options to disable ssl verification
  
  - New libcurl options CURLOPT_DOH_SSL_VERIFYHOST,
    CURLOPT_DOH_SSL_VERIFYPEER and CURLOPT_DOH_SSL_VERIFYSTATUS do the
    same as their respective counterparts.
  
  - New curl tool options --doh-insecure and --doh-cert-status do the same
    as their respective counterparts.
  
  Prior to this change DOH SSL certificate verification settings for
  verifyhost and verifypeer were supposed to be inherited respectively
  from CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST and CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, but due to a bug
  were not. As a result DOH verification remained at the default, ie
  enabled, and it was not possible to disable. This commit changes
  behavior so that the DOH verification settings are independent and not
  inherited.

- hostip: fix crash in sync resolver builds that use DOH
  
  - Guard some Curl_async accesses with USE_CURL_ASYNC instead of
    !CURLRES_SYNCH.
  
  This is another follow-up to 8335c64 which moved the async struct from
  the connectdata struct into the Curl_easy struct. A previous follow-up
  6cd167a fixed building for sync resolver by guarding some async struct
  accesses with !CURLRES_SYNCH. The problem is since DOH (DNS-over-HTTPS)
  is available as an asynchronous secondary resolver the async struct may
  be used even when libcurl is built for the sync resolver. That means
  that CURLRES_SYNCH and USE_CURL_ASYNC may be defined at the same time.

- http: use credentials from transfer, not connection
  
  HTTP auth "accidentally" worked before this cleanup since the code would
  always overwrite the connection credentials with the credentials from
  the most recent transfer and since HTTP auth is typically done first
  thing, this has not been an issue. It was still wrong and subject to
  possible race conditions or future breakage if the sequence of functions
  would change.
  
  The data.set.str[] strings MUST remain unmodified exactly as set by the
  user, and the credentials to use internally are instead set/updated in
  state.aptr.*
  
  Added test 675 to verify different credentials used in two requests done
  over a reused HTTP connection, which previously behaved wrongly.

  There is still a fair bit to be done, like sending CloseNotify on

- tool_writeout: refactor write-out and write-out json
  
  - Deduplicate the logic used by write-out and write-out json.

  functions that can output either format and a 'use_json' parameter to
  indicate whether it is json that is output.
  
  This will make it easier to maintain. Rather than have to go through
  two sets of logic now we only have to go through one.
  
  - Support write-out %{errormsg} and %{exitcode} in json.
  
  - Clarify in the doc that %{exitcode} is the exit code of the transfer.

- curl_multibyte: fall back to local code page stat/access on Windows
  
  If libcurl is built with Unicode support for Windows then it is assumed
  the filename string is Unicode in UTF-8 encoding and it is converted to
  UTF-16 to be passed to the wide character version of the respective
  function (eg wstat). However the filename string may actually be in the
  local encoding so, even if it successfully converted to UTF-16, if it
  could not be stat/accessed then try again using the local code page
  version of the function (eg wstat fails try stat).
  
  We already do this with fopen (ie wfopen fails try fopen), so I think it
  makes sense to extend it to stat and access functions.

  cmake: fix import library name for non-MS compiler on Windows
  
  - Use _imp.lib suffix only for Microsoft's compiler (MSVC).
  
  Prior to this change library suffix _imp.lib was used for the import
  library on Windows regardless of compiler.
  
  With this change the other compilers should now use their default
  suffix which should be .dll.a.
  
  This change is motivated by the usage of pkg-config on MSYS2.
  Indeed, when 'pkg-config --libs libcurl' is used, -lcurl is
  passed to ld. The documentation of ld on Windows :
  
  https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs/ld/WIN32.html
  
  lists, in the 'direct linking to a dll' section, the pattern
  of the searched import library, and libcurl_imp.lib is not there.

  tests/server: Bump MAX_TAG_LEN to 200
  
  This is useful for tests containing HTML inside of <data> sections.
  For <img> tags it's not uncommon to be longer than the previous
  limit of 79 bytes.
  
  An example of a previously problem-causing tag is:
  <img src="http://config.privoxy.org/send-banner?type=auto" border="0" title="Killed-http://www.privoxy.org/images/privoxy.png-by-size" width="88" height="31">
  which is needed for a Privoxy test for the banners-by-size filter.
  
  Previously it caused server failures like:

  runtests.pl: add an -E option to specify an exclude file
  
  It can contain additional restraints for test numbers,

  The idea is to let third parties like the Privoxy project
  distribute an exclude file with their tarballs that specifies
  which curl tests are not expected to work when using Privoxy
  as a proxy, without having to fork the whole curl test suite.
  
  The syntax could be changed to be extendable and maybe
  more closely reflect the "curl test" syntax. Currently
  it's a bunch of lines like these:
  
  test:$TESTNUMBER:Reason why this test with number $TESTNUMBER should be skipped
  keyword:$KEYWORD:Reason why tests whose keywords contain the $KEYWORD should be skipped
  tool:$TOOL:Reason why tests with tools that contain $TOOL should be skipped
  
  To specify multiple $TESTNUMBERs, $KEYWORDs and $TOOLs
  on a single line, split them with commas.

  This is useful to change the behaviour of the script without

  Such differences are proxy-specific and thus the modifications
  should be maintained together with the proxy.

  runtests.pl: add a -P option to specify an external proxy
  
  ... that should be used when executing the tests.
  
  The assumption is that the proxy is an HTTP proxy.
  
  This option should be used together with -L to provide
  a customized compareparts() version that knows which
  proxy-specific header differences should be ignored.
  
  This option doesn't work for all test types yet.

  so without losing readability.

  Closes #6492

- socks: use the download buffer instead
  
  The SOCKS code now uses the generic download buffer for temporary
  storage during the connection procedure, instead of having its own
  private 600 byte buffer that adds to the connectdata struct size. This
  works fine because this point the buffer is allocated but is not use for
  download yet since the connection hasn't completed.
  
  This reduces the connection struct size by 22% on a 64bit arch!
  
  The SOCKS buffer needs to be at least 600 bytes, and the download buffer
  is guaranteed to never be smaller than 1000 bytes.
  
  Closes #6491

- urldata: make magic be the first struct field
  
  By making the `magic` identifier the same size and at the same place

  wrong handle to APIs. Easier to detect and less likely to cause crashes

  Third party libraries SHOULD NOT require free() to release allocated
  resources for this reason - and libs can use separate healp allocators

  anyway.

- lib: pass in 'struct Curl_easy *' to most functions
  
  ... in most cases instead of 'struct connectdata *' but in some cases in

  - We mostly operate on transfers and not connections.
  
  - We need the transfer handle to log, store data and more. Everything in
    libcurl is driven by a transfer (the CURL * in the public API).
  
  - This work clarifies and separates the transfers from the connections
    better.
  
  - We should avoid "conn->data". Since individual connections can be used
    by many transfers when multiplexing, making sure that conn->data
    points to the current and correct transfer at all times is difficult
    and has been notoriously error-prone over the years. The goal is to
    ultimately remove the conn->data pointer for this reason.

- gitattributes: Set batch files to CRLF line endings on checkout
  
  If a batch file is run without CRLF line endings (ie LF-only) then
  arbitrary behavior may occur. I consider that a bug in Windows, however
  the effects can be serious enough (eg unintended code executed) that
  we're fixing it in the repo by requiring CRLF line endings for batch
  files on checkout.
  
  Prior to this change the checked-out line endings of batch files were
  dependent on a user's git preferences. On Windows it is common for git
  users to have automatic CRLF conversion enabled (core.autocrlf true),
  but those users that don't would run into this behavior.
  
  For example a user has reported running the Visual Studio project
  generator batch file (projects/generate.bat) and it looped forever.
  Output showed that the Windows OS interpreter was occasionally jumping
  to arbitrary points in the batch file and executing commands. This
  resulted in unintended files being removed (a removal sequence called)
  and looping forever.

- TODO: --fail-with-body perchance?

Jay Satiro (4 Jan 2021)
- tool_operate: fix the suppression logic of some error messages
  
  - Fix the failed truncation and failed writing body error messages to
    not be shown unless error messages are shown. (ie the user has
    specified -sS, or has not specified -s).
  
  - Also prefix same error messages with "curl: ", for example:
    curl: (23) Failed to truncate, exiting
  
  Prior to this change the failed truncation error messages would be shown
  if not -s, but did not account for -sS which should show.
  
  Prior to this change the failed writing body error messages would be
  shown always.

- wolfssl: Support wolfSSL builds missing TLS 1.1
  
  The wolfSSL TLS library defines NO_OLD_TLS in some of their build
  configurations and that causes the library to be built without TLS 1.1.
  For example if MD5 is explicitly disabled when building wolfSSL then
  that defines NO_OLD_TLS and the library is built without TLS 1.1 [1].
  
  Prior to this change attempting to build curl with a wolfSSL that was
  built with NO_OLD_TLS would cause a build link error undefined reference
  to wolfTLSv1_client_method.

  http: introduce AWS HTTP v4 Signature
  
  It is a security process for HTTP.
  
  It doesn't seems to be standard, but it is used by some cloud providers.
  
  Aws:
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html
  Outscale:
  https://wiki.outscale.net/display/EN/Creating+a+Canonical+Request
  GCP (I didn't test that this code work with GCP though):
  https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signing-urls-manually
  
  most of the code is in lib/http_v4_signature.c
  
  Information require by the algorithm:
  - The URL
  - Current time
  -  some prefix that are append to some of the signature parameters.
  
  The data extracted from the URL are: the URI, the region,
  the host and the API type
  
  example:
  https://api.eu-west-2.outscale.com/api/latest/ReadNets
          ~~~ ~~~~~~~~               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          ^       ^                          ^
         /         \                        URI
     API type     region
  
  Small description of the algorithm:
  - make canonical header using content type, the host, and the date
  - hash the post data
  - make canonical_request using custom request, the URI,
    the get data, the canonical header, the signed header
    and post data hash
  - hash canonical_request
  - make str_to_sign using one of the prefix pass in parameter,
    the date, the credential scope and the canonical_request hash
  - compute hmac from date, using secret key as key.
  - compute hmac from region, using above hmac as key
  - compute hmac from api_type, using above hmac as key
  - compute hmac from request_type, using above hmac as key
  - compute hmac from str_to_sign using above hmac as key
  - create Authorization header using above hmac, prefix pass in parameter,

  gopher: Implement secure gopher protocol.
  
  This commit introduces a "gophers" handler inside the gopher protocol if
  USE_SSL is defined. This protocol is no different than the usual gopher
  prococol, with the added TLS encapsulation upon connecting. The protocol
  has been adopted in the gopher community, and many people have enabled
  TLS in their gopher daemons like geomyidae(8), and clients, like clic(1)
  and hurl(1).
  
  I have not implemented test units for this protocol because my knowledge
  of Perl is sub-par. However, for someone more knowledgeable it might be
  fairly trivial, because the same test that tests the plain gopher
  protocol can be used for "gophers" just by adding a TLS listener.

  strerror: Revert to local codepage for Windows error string
  
  - Change get_winapi_error() to return the error string in the local
    codepage instead of UTF-8 encoding.
  
  Two weeks ago bed5f84 fixed get_winapi_error() to work on xbox, but it
  also changed the error string's encoding from local codepage to UTF-8.
  
  We return the local codepage version of the error string because if it
  is output to the user's terminal it will likely be with functions which
  expect the local codepage (eg fprintf, failf, infof).
  
  This is essentially a partial revert of bed5f84. The support for xbox
  remains but the error string is reverted back to local codepage.

- ftp: a 550 response to SIZE returns CURLE_REMOTE_FILE_NOT_FOUND
  
  This is primarily interesting for cases where CURLOPT_NOBODY is set as
  previously curl would not return an error for this case.
  
  MDTM getting 550 now also returns this error (it returned
  CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_RETR_FILE before) in order to unify return codes for
  missing files across protocols and specific FTP commands.
  
  libcurl already returns error on a 550 as a MDTM response (when
  CURLOPT_FILETIME is set). If CURLOPT_NOBODY is not set, an error would
  happen subsequently anyway since the RETR command would fail.
  
  Add test 1913 and 1914 to verify. Updated several tests accordingly due
  to the updated SIZE behavior.

  imap: set cselect_bits to CURL_CSELECT_IN initially
  
  ... when continuing a transfer from a FETCH response.
  
  When the size of the file was small enough that the entirety of the
  transfer happens in a single go and schannel buffers holds the entire
  data. However, it wasn't completely read in Curl_pp_readresp since a
  line break was found before that could happen. So, by the time we are in
  imap_state_fetch_resp - there's data in buffers that needs to be read
  via Curl_read but nothing to read from the socket. After we setup a
  transfer (Curl_setup_transfer), curl just waits on the socket state to
  change - which doesn't happen since no new data ever comes.

  http: consolidate nghttp2_session_mem_recv() call paths
  
  Previously there were several locations that called
  nghttp2_session_mem_recv and handled responses slightly differently.
  Those have been converted to call the existing
  h2_process_pending_input() function.
  
  Moved the end-of-session check to h2_process_pending_input() since the
  only place the end-of-session state can change is after nghttp2
  processes additional input frames.
  
  This will likely fix the fuzzing error. While I don't have a root cause
  the out-of-bounds read seems like a use after free, so moving the
  nghttp2_session_check_request_allowed() call to a location with a
  guaranteed nghttp2 session seems reasonable.
  
  Also updated a few nghttp2 callsites to include error messages and added
  a few additional error checks.

- multi: expand pre-check for socket readiness
  
  Check readiness of all sockets before waiting on them
  to avoid locking in case the one-time event FD_WRITE
  was already consumed by a previous wait operation.
  
  More information about WinSock network events:

     winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaeventselect#return-value
  
  Closes #5634

  multi: implement wait using winsock events
  
  This avoids using a pair of TCP ports to provide wakeup functionality
  for every multi instance on Windows, where socketpair() is emulated
  using a TCP socket on loopback which could in turn lead to socket
  resource exhaustion.
  
  A previous version of this patch failed to account for how in WinSock,
  FD_WRITE is set only once when writing becomes possible and not again
  until after a send has failed due to the buffer filling. This contrasts
  to how FD_READ and FD_OOB continue to be set until the conditions they
  refer to no longer apply. This meant that if a user wrote some data to
  a socket, but not enough data to completely fill its send buffer, then
  waited on that socket to become writable, we'd erroneously stall until
  their configured timeout rather than returning immediately.
  
  This version of the patch addresses that issue by checking each socket
  we're waiting on to become writable with select() before the wait, and
  zeroing the timeout if it's already writable.

- select: fix poll-based check not detecting connect failure
  
  This commit changes Curl_socket_check to use POLLPRI to
  check for connect failure on the write socket, because
  POLLPRI maps to fds_err. This is in line with select(2).
  
  The select-based socket check correctly checks for connect
  failures by adding the write socket also to fds_err.
  
  The poll-based implementation (which internally can itself
  fallback to select again) did not previously check for
  connect failure by using POLLPRI with the write socket.
  
  See the follow up commit to this for more information.
  
  This commit makes sure connect failures can be detected
  and handled if HAVE_POLL_FINE is defined, eg. on msys2-devel.
