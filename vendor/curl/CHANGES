  strerror: Revert to local codepage for Windows error string
  
  - Change get_winapi_error() to return the error string in the local
    codepage instead of UTF-8 encoding.
  
  Two weeks ago bed5f84 fixed get_winapi_error() to work on xbox, but it
  also changed the error string's encoding from local codepage to UTF-8.
  
  We return the local codepage version of the error string because if it
  is output to the user's terminal it will likely be with functions which
  expect the local codepage (eg fprintf, failf, infof).
  
  This is essentially a partial revert of bed5f84. The support for xbox
  remains but the error string is reverted back to local codepage.

- ftp: a 550 response to SIZE returns CURLE_REMOTE_FILE_NOT_FOUND
  
  This is primarily interesting for cases where CURLOPT_NOBODY is set as
  previously curl would not return an error for this case.
  
  MDTM getting 550 now also returns this error (it returned
  CURLE_FTP_COULDNT_RETR_FILE before) in order to unify return codes for
  missing files across protocols and specific FTP commands.
  
  libcurl already returns error on a 550 as a MDTM response (when
  CURLOPT_FILETIME is set). If CURLOPT_NOBODY is not set, an error would
  happen subsequently anyway since the RETR command would fail.
  
  Add test 1913 and 1914 to verify. Updated several tests accordingly due
  to the updated SIZE behavior.

  imap: set cselect_bits to CURL_CSELECT_IN initially
  
  ... when continuing a transfer from a FETCH response.
  
  When the size of the file was small enough that the entirety of the
  transfer happens in a single go and schannel buffers holds the entire
  data. However, it wasn't completely read in Curl_pp_readresp since a
  line break was found before that could happen. So, by the time we are in
  imap_state_fetch_resp - there's data in buffers that needs to be read
  via Curl_read but nothing to read from the socket. After we setup a
  transfer (Curl_setup_transfer), curl just waits on the socket state to
  change - which doesn't happen since no new data ever comes.

  http: consolidate nghttp2_session_mem_recv() call paths
  
  Previously there were several locations that called
  nghttp2_session_mem_recv and handled responses slightly differently.
  Those have been converted to call the existing
  h2_process_pending_input() function.
  
  Moved the end-of-session check to h2_process_pending_input() since the
  only place the end-of-session state can change is after nghttp2
  processes additional input frames.
  
  This will likely fix the fuzzing error. While I don't have a root cause
  the out-of-bounds read seems like a use after free, so moving the
  nghttp2_session_check_request_allowed() call to a location with a
  guaranteed nghttp2 session seems reasonable.
  
  Also updated a few nghttp2 callsites to include error messages and added
  a few additional error checks.

- multi: expand pre-check for socket readiness
  
  Check readiness of all sockets before waiting on them
  to avoid locking in case the one-time event FD_WRITE
  was already consumed by a previous wait operation.
  
  More information about WinSock network events:
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/
     winsock2/nf-winsock2-wsaeventselect#return-value
  
  Closes #5634

- [rcombs brought this change]

  multi: implement wait using winsock events
  
  This avoids using a pair of TCP ports to provide wakeup functionality
  for every multi instance on Windows, where socketpair() is emulated
  using a TCP socket on loopback which could in turn lead to socket
  resource exhaustion.
  
  A previous version of this patch failed to account for how in WinSock,
  FD_WRITE is set only once when writing becomes possible and not again
  until after a send has failed due to the buffer filling. This contrasts
  to how FD_READ and FD_OOB continue to be set until the conditions they
  refer to no longer apply. This meant that if a user wrote some data to
  a socket, but not enough data to completely fill its send buffer, then
  waited on that socket to become writable, we'd erroneously stall until
  their configured timeout rather than returning immediately.
  
  This version of the patch addresses that issue by checking each socket
  we're waiting on to become writable with select() before the wait, and
  zeroing the timeout if it's already writable.

- select: fix poll-based check not detecting connect failure
  
  This commit changes Curl_socket_check to use POLLPRI to
  check for connect failure on the write socket, because
  POLLPRI maps to fds_err. This is in line with select(2).
  
  The select-based socket check correctly checks for connect
  failures by adding the write socket also to fds_err.
  
  The poll-based implementation (which internally can itself
  fallback to select again) did not previously check for
  connect failure by using POLLPRI with the write socket.
  
  See the follow up commit to this for more information.
  
  This commit makes sure connect failures can be detected
  and handled if HAVE_POLL_FINE is defined, eg. on msys2-devel.

  mprintf: Fix stack overflows
  
  Stack overflows can occur with precisions for integers and floats.
  
  Proof of concepts:
  - curl_mprintf("%d, %.*1$d", 500, 1);
  - curl_mprintf("%d, %+0500.*1$f", 500, 1);
  
  Ideally, compile with -fsanitize=address which makes this undefined
  behavior a bit more defined for debug purposes.
  
  The format strings are valid. The overflows occur due to invalid
  arguments. If these arguments are variables with contents controlled
  by an attacker, the function's stack can be corrupted.
  
  Also see CVE-2016-9586 which partially fixed the float aspect.

  mprintf: Fix dollar string handling
  
  Verify that specified parameters are in range. If parameters are too
  large, fail early on and avoid out of boundary accesses.
  
  Also do not read behind boundaries of illegal format strings.
  
  These are defensive measures since it is expected that format strings
  are well-formed. Format strings should not be modifiable by user
  input due to possible generic format string attacks.

  http2: close the http2 connection when no more requests may be sent
  
  Well-behaving HTTP2 servers send two GOAWAY messages. The first
  message is a warning that indicates that the server is going to
  stop accepting streams. The second one actually closes the stream.
  
  nghttp2 reports this state (and the other state of no more stream
  identifiers) via the call nghttp2_session_check_request_allowed().
  In this state the client should not create more streams on the
  session (tcp connection), and in curl this means that the server
  has requested that the connection is closed.
  
  It would be also be possible to put the connclose() call into the
  on_http2_frame_recv() function that triggers on the GOAWAY message.
  
  This fixes a bug seen when the client sees the following sequence of
  frames:
  
  // advisory GOAWAY
  HTTP2 GOAWAY [stream-id = 0, promised-stream-id = -1]
  ... some additional frames
  
  // final GOAWAY
  HTTP2 GOAWAY [stream-id = 0, promised-stream-id = N ]
  
  Before this change, curl will attempt to reuse the connection even
  after the last stream, will encounter this error:
  
  * Found bundle for host localhost: 0x5595f0a694e0 [can multiplex]
  * Re-using existing connection! (#0) with host localhost
  * Connected to localhost (::1) port 10443 (#0)
  * Using Stream ID: 9 (easy handle 0x5595f0a72e30)
  > GET /index.html?5 HTTP/2
  > Host: localhost:10443
  > user-agent: curl/7.68.0
  > accept: */*
  >
  * stopped the pause stream!
  * Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
  curl: (16) Error in the HTTP2 framing layer
  
  This error may posion the connection cache, causing future requests
  which resolve to the same curl connection to go through the same error
  path.

- openssl: Don't ignore CA paths when using Windows CA store
  
  This commit changes the behavior of CURLSSLOPT_NATIVE_CA so that it does
  not override CURLOPT_CAINFO / CURLOPT_CAPATH, or the hardcoded default
  locations. Instead the CA store can now be used at the same time.
  
  The change is due to the impending release. The issue is still being
  discussed. The behavior of CURLSSLOPT_NATIVE_CA is subject to change and
  is now documented as experimental.
  
  Ref: bc052cc (parent commit)
  Ref: https://github.com/curl/curl/issues/5585

- tool_operate: Don't use Windows CA store as a fallback
  
  Background:
  
  148534d added CURLSSLOPT_NATIVE_CA to use the Windows OS certificate
  store in libcurl w/ OpenSSL on Windows. CURLSSLOPT_NATIVE_CA overrides
  CURLOPT_CAINFO if both are set. The curl tool will fall back to
  CURLSSLOPT_NATIVE_CA if it could not find a certificate bundle to set
  via CURLOPT_CAINFO.
  
  Problem:
  
  libcurl may be built with hardcoded paths to a certificate bundle or
  directory, and if CURLSSLOPT_NATIVE_CA is used then those paths are
  ignored.
  
  Solution:
  
  A solution is still being discussed but since there's an impending
  release this commit removes using CURLSSLOPT_NATIVE_CA in the curl tool.

- ngtcp2: use common key log routine for better thread-safety
  
  Tested with ngtcp2 built against the OpenSSL library. Additionally
  tested with MultiSSL (NSS for TLS and ngtcp2+OpenSSL for QUIC).
  
  The TLS backend (independent of QUIC) may or may not already have opened
  the keylog file before. Therefore Curl_tls_keylog_open is always called
  to ensure the file is open.

- wolfssl: add SSLKEYLOGFILE support
  
  Tested following the same curl and tshark commands as in commit
  "vtls: Extract and simplify key log file handling from OpenSSL" using
  WolfSSL v4.4.0-stable-128-g5179503e8 from git master built with
  `./configure --enable-all --enable-debug CFLAGS=-DHAVE_SECRET_CALLBACK`.
  
  Full support for this feature requires certain wolfSSL build options,
  see "Availability note" in lib/vtls/wolfssl.c for details.
  
  Closes #5327

- vtls: Extract and simplify key log file handling from OpenSSL
  
  Create a set of routines for TLS key log file handling to enable reuse
  with other TLS backends. Simplify the OpenSSL backend as follows:
  
   - Drop the ENABLE_SSLKEYLOGFILE macro as it is unconditionally enabled.
   - Do not perform dynamic memory allocation when preparing a log entry.
     Unless the TLS specifications change we can suffice with a reasonable
     fixed-size buffer.
   - Simplify state tracking when SSL_CTX_set_keylog_callback is
     unavailable. My original sslkeylog.c code included this tracking in
     order to handle multiple calls to SSL_connect and detect new keys
     after renegotiation (via SSL_read/SSL_write). For curl however we can
     be sure that a single master secret eventually becomes available
     after SSL_connect, so a simple flag is sufficient. An alternative to
     the flag is examining SSL_state(), but this seems more complex and is
     not pursued. Capturing keys after server renegotiation was already
     unsupported in curl and remains unsupported.
  
  Tested with curl built against OpenSSL 0.9.8zh, 1.0.2u, and 1.1.1f
  (`SSLKEYLOGFILE=keys.txt curl -vkso /dev/null https://localhost:4433`)
  against an OpenSSL 1.1.1f server configured with:
  
      # Force non-TLSv1.3, use TLSv1.0 since 0.9.8 fails with 1.1 or 1.2
      openssl s_server -www -tls1
      # Likewise, but fail the server handshake.
      openssl s_server -www -tls1 -Verify 2
      # TLS 1.3 test. No need to test the failing server handshake.
      openssl s_server -www -tls1_3
  
  Verify that all secrets (1 for TLS 1.0, 4 for TLS 1.3) are correctly
  written using Wireshark. For the first and third case, expect four
  matches per connection (decrypted Server Finished, Client Finished, HTTP
  Request, HTTP Response). For the second case where the handshake fails,
  expect a decrypted Server Finished only.
  
      tshark -i lo -pf tcp -otls.keylog_file:keys.txt -Tfields \
          -eframe.number -eframe.time -etcp.stream -e_ws.col.Info \
          -dtls.port==4433,http -ohttp.desegment_body:FALSE \
          -Y 'tls.handshake.verify_data or http'
  
  A single connection can easily be identified via the `tcp.stream` field.

- curl: remove -J "informational" written on stdout
  
  curl would previously show "curl: Saved to filename 'name from header'"

  This commit removes that output line.

- travis: simplify quiche build instructions wrt boringssl
  
  quiche builds boringssl as static library, reuse that instead of
  building another shared library.
  
  Closes #5438

- configure: fix pthread check with static boringssl
  
  A shared boringssl/OpenSSL library requires -lcrypto only for linking.
  A static build additionally requires `-ldl -lpthread`. In the latter
  case `-lpthread` is added to LIBS which prevented `-pthread` from being
  added to CFLAGS. Clear LIBS to fix linking failures for libtest tests.

- travis: upgrade to bionic, clang-9, improve readability
  
  Changes, partially to reduce build failures from external dependencies:
   - Upgrade Ubuntu and drop unnecessary third-party repos.
   - Properly clone apt config to ensure retries.
   - Upgrade to clang-9 from the standard repos.
   - Use Ubuntu 20.04 focal for the libssh build, use of ssh_get_publickey
     fails on -Werror=deprecated-declarations in Ubuntu 18.04. Do not use
     focal everywhere yet since Travis CI has not documented this option.
     In focal, python-impacket (Py2.7) has been removed, leaving only
     python3-impacket. Since it is only needed for SMB tests and not SSH,
     skip it for the libssh job since it might need more work.
   - apt: Remove gcc-8 and libstdc++-8-dev, already installed via g++-8.
  
  Non-functional cleanups:
   - Simplify test matrix, drop redundant os and compiler keys.

    UTF-8
  
  This makes it possible to pass parameters with characters outside of
  the current locale on Windows, which is required for some tests, e.g.
  the IDN tests. Out of the box, this currently only works with the
  Visual Studio project files, which default to Unicode, and winbuild

  libcurl.pc: Merge Libs.private into Libs for static-only builds
  
  A project being built entirely statically will call pkg-config with
  --static, which utilises the Libs.private field. Conversely it will
  not use --static when not being built entirely statically, even if
  there is only a static build of libcurl available. This will most
  likely cause the build to fail due to underlinking unless we merge the
  Libs fields.
  
  Consider that this is what the Meson build system does when it
  generates pkg-config files.
  
  I have also reflected this in the --libs argument of curl-config even
  though REQUIRE_LIB_DEPS always seems to be "yes" anyway.

      since all unittests are already broken and not built by default.
    * Add new test targets based on the options from Makefile.am. Since
      new test targets are rarely added, I opted for duplicating the
      runtests.pl options as opposed to creating a new Makefile.inc file.

- test1238: avoid tftpd being busy for tests shortly following
  
  The tftpd server may still be busy if the total timeout of
  25 seconds has not been reached or no sread error was received
  during or after the execution of the timeout test 1238.
  
  Once the next TFTP test comes around (eg. 1242 or 1243),
  those will fail because the tftpd server is still waiting
  on data from curl due to the UDP protocol being stateless
  and having no connection close. On Linux this error may not
  happen, because ICMP errors generated due to a swrite error
  can also be returned async on the next sread call instead.
  
  Therefore we will now just kill the tftpd server after test
  1238 to make sure that the following tests are not affected.
  
  This enables us to no longer ignore tests 1242, 1243, 2002
  and 2003 on the CI platforms CirrusCI and AppVeyor.

  CMake: add HTTP/3 support (ngtcp2+nghttp3, quiche)
  
  Add three new CMake Find modules (using the curl license, but I grant
  others the right to apply the CMake BSD license instead).
  
  This CMake config is simpler than the autotools one because it assumes
  ngtcp2 and nghttp3 to be used together. Another difference is that this
  CMake config checks whether QUIC is actually supported by the TLS
  library (patched OpenSSL or boringssl) since this can be a common
  configuration mistake that could result in build errors later.
  
  Unlike autotools, CMake does not warn you that the features are
  experimental. The user is supposed to already know that and read the
  documentation. It requires a very special build environment anyway.
  
  Tested with ngtcp2+OpenSSL+nghttp3 and quiche+boringssl, both built from
  current git master. Use `LD_DEBUG=files src/curl |& grep need` to figure
  out which features (libldap-2.4, libssh2) to disable due to conflicts

  The convention is to enable logging when the QLOGDIR environment is
  set. This should be a path to a folder where files are written with the
  naming template <SCID>.qlog.

- asyn-thread: fix cppcheck warning
  
  - Check for NULL entry parameter before attempting to deref entry in
    Curl_resolver_is_resolved, like is already done in asyn-ares.
  
  This is to silence cppcheck which does not seem to understand that
  asyn-ares and asyn-thread have separate Curl_resolver_is_resolved
  and those units are mutually exclusive. Prior to this change it warned
  of a scenario where asyn-thread's Curl_resolver_is_resolved is called
  with a NULL entry from asyn-ares, but that couldn't happen.

- sockfilt: make select_ws stop waiting on exit signal event
  
  This makes sure that select_ws behaves similar to real select
  which stops waiting on a signal handler being triggered.
  
  This makes it possible to gracefully stop sockfilt.exe on
  Windows with taskkill /IM sockfilt.exe (without /F force flag).

- tests/server/util.[ch]: add exit event to stop waiting on Windows
  
  This commit adds a global exit event to the test servers that
  Windows-specific wait routines can use to get triggered if the
  program was signaled to be terminated, eg. select_ws in sockfilt.c
  
  The exit event will be managed by the signal handling code and is
  set to not reset automatically to support multiple wait routines.

  When SRP is requested in the priority string, GnuTLS will disable

  With this change, +SRP is only added to the priority list when SRP

  our known perl.exe Cygwin/msys PID together with exec() in order
  to tie the spawned processes to the existance of our perl.exe
  
  The perl.exe that is executing secureserver.pl and sshserver.pl
  has a Cygwin/msys PID, because it is started inside Cygwin/msys.

- lib: fix conversion warnings for SOCKET_WRITABLE/READABLE
  
  - If loss of data may occur converting a timediff_t to time_t and
    the time value is > TIME_T_MAX then treat it as TIME_T_MAX.
  
  This is a follow-up to 8843678 which removed the (time_t) typecast
  from the macros so that conversion warnings could be identified.

- test1148: tolerate progress updates better (again)
  
  - Ignore intermediate progress updates.
  
  - Support locales that use a character other than period as decimal
    separator (eg 100,0%).
  
  test1148 checks that the progress finishes at 100% and has the right
  bar width. Prior to this change the test assumed that the only progress
  reported for such a quick transfer was 100%, however in rare instances
  (like in the CI where transfer time can slow considerably) there may be
  intermediate updates. For example, below is stderrlog1148 from a failed
  CI run with explicit \r and \n added (it is one line; broken up so that
  it's easier to understand).
  
  \r
  \r##################################                                        48.3%
  \r######################################################################## 100.0%

  CURLINFO_CONDITION_UNMET: return true for 304 http status code
  
  In libcurl, CURLINFO_CONDITION_UNMET is used to avoid writing to the
  output file if the server did not transfered a file based on time
  condition. In the same manner, getting a 304 HTTP response back from the
  server, for example after passing a custom If-Match-* header, also
  fulfill this condition.

- sockfilt: fix handling of ready closed sockets on Windows
  
  Replace the incomplete workaround regarding FD_CLOSE
  only signalling once by instead doing a pre-check with

  select keeps triggering on closed sockets on Windows while
  WSAEventSelect fires only once with data still available.
  By doing the pre-check we do not run in a deadlock
  due to waiting forever for another FD_CLOSE event.
