  mbedtls: fix private member designations for v3.1.0
  
  "As a last resort, you can access the field foo of a structure bar by
  writing bar.MBEDTLS_PRIVATE(foo). Note that you do so at your own risk,
  since such code is likely to break in a future minor version of Mbed
  TLS." -

  That future minor version is v3.1.0. I set the >= to == for the version
  checks because v3.1.0 is a release, and I am not sure when the private
  designation was reverted after v3.0.0.

  Make ngtcp2+quictls correctly acknowledge `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` and
  `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST`.
  
  The name check now uses a function from lib/vtls/openssl.c which will
  need attention for when TLS is not done by OpenSSL or is disabled while
  QUIC is enabled.
  
  Possibly the servercert() function in openssl.c should be adjusted to be
  able to use for both regular TLS and QUIC.

  The homedir() function is now renamed into findfile() and iterates over

  available. Previously it would first try to find a home directory and if
  that was set, insist on checking only that directory for the file. This
  now returns the full file name it finds.
  
  The Windows specific checks are now done differently too and in this
  order:
  
  1 - %USERPROFILE%
  2 - %APPDATA%
  3 - %USERPROFILE%\\Application Data

  when it searches for .ssh/known_hosts.

- urlapi: provide more detailed return codes
  
  Previously, the return code CURLUE_MALFORMED_INPUT was used for almost
  30 different URL format violations. This made it hard for users to
  understand why a particular URL was not acceptable. Since the API cannot
  point out a specific position within the URL for the problem, this now
  instead introduces a number of additional and more fine-grained error

  rustls: read of zero bytes might be okay
  
  When we're reading out plaintext from rustls' internal buffers, we might
  get a read of zero bytes (meaning a clean TCP close, including
  close_notify). However, we shouldn't return immediately when that
  happens, since we may have already copied out some plaintext bytes.
  Break out of the loop when we get a read of zero bytes, and figure out
  which path we're dealing with.

  rustls: remove incorrect EOF check
  
  The update to rustls-ffi 0.8.0 changed handling of EOF and close_notify.
  From the CHANGELOG:
  
  > Handling of unclean close and the close_notify TLS alert. Mirroring
  > upstream changes, a rustls_connection now tracks TCP closed state like
  > so: rustls_connection_read_tls considers a 0-length read from its
  > callback to mean "TCP stream was closed by peer."  If that happens
  > before the peer sent close_notify, rustls_connection_read will return
  > RUSTLS_RESULT_UNEXPECTED_EOF once the available plaintext bytes are
  > exhausted. This is useful to protect against truncation attacks. Note:
  > some TLS implementations don't send close_notify. If you are already
  > getting length information from your protocol (e.g. Content-Length in
  > HTTP) you may choose to ignore UNEXPECTED_EOF so long as the number of
  > plaintext bytes was as expected.
  
  That means we don't need to check for unclean EOF in `cr_recv()`,
  because `process_new_packets()` will give us an error if appropriate.

  configure: don't enable TLS when --without-* flags are used
  
  Previously specifying `--without-gnutls` would unexpectedly attempt to
  compile with GnuTLS, effectively interpreting this as
  `--with-gnutls`. This caused a significant amount of confusion when
  `libcurl` was built with SSL disabled since GnuTLS wasn't present.
  
  68d89f24 dropped the `--without-*` options from the configure help, but
  `AC_ARG_WITH` still defines these flags automatically. As
  https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/autoconf-2.60/html_node/External-Software.html
  describes, the `action-if-given` is called when the user specifies
  `--with-*` or `--without-*` options.
  
  To prevent this confusion, we make the `--without` flag do the right
  thing by ignoring the value if it set to "no".

  sendf: accept zero-length data in Curl_client_write()
  
  Historically, Curl_client_write() used a length value of 0 as a marker
  for a null-terminated data string. This feature has been removed in
  commit f4b85d2. To detect leftover uses of the feature, a DEBUGASSERT
  statement rejecting a length with value 0 was introduced, effectively
  precluding use of this function with zero-length data.
  
  The current commit removes the DEBUGASSERT and makes the function to
  return immediately if length is 0.
  
  A direct effect is to fix trying to output a zero-length distinguished
  name in openldap.
  
  Another DEBUGASSERT statement is also rephrased for better readability.

- Makefile.m32: fix to not require OpenSSL with -libssh2 or -rtmp options
  
  Previously, -libssh2/-rtmp options assumed that OpenSSL is also enabled
  (and then failed with an error when not finding expected OpenSSL headers),
  but this isn't necessarly true, e.g. when building both libssh2 and curl
  against Schannel. This patch makes sure to only enable the OpenSSL backend
  with -libssh2/-rtmp, when there was no SSL option explicitly selected.
  
  - Re-implement the logic as a single block of script.

- http: set content length earlier
  
  - Make content length (ie download size) accessible to the user in the
    header callback, but only after all headers have been processed (ie
    only in the final call to the header callback).
  
  Background:
  
  For a long time the content length could be retrieved in the header
  callback via CURLINFO_CONTENT_LENGTH_DOWNLOAD_T as soon as it was parsed
  by curl.
  
  Changes were made in 8a16e54 (precedes 7.79.0) to ignore content length
  if any transfer encoding is used. A side effect of that was that
  content length was not set by libcurl until after the header callback
  was called the final time, because until all headers are processed it
  cannot be determined if content length is valid.
  
  This change keeps the same intention --all headers must be processed--
  but now the content length is available before the final call to the
  header function that indicates all headers have been processed (ie
  a blank header).

- lib: avoid fallthrough cases in switch statements
  
  Commit b5a434f7f0ee4d64857f8592eced5b9007d83620 inhibits the warning
  on implicit fallthrough cases, since the current coding of indicating
  fallthrough with comments is falling out of fashion with new compilers.
  This attempts to make the issue smaller by rewriting fallthroughs to no
  longer fallthrough, via either breaking the cases or turning switch
  statements into if statements.
  
    lib/content_encoding.c: the fallthrough codepath is simply copied
      into the case as it's a single line.
    lib/http_ntlm.c: the fallthrough case skips a state in the state-
      machine and fast-forwards to NTLMSTATE_LAST. Do this before the
      switch statement instead to set up the states that we actually
      want.
    lib/http_proxy.c: the fallthrough is just falling into exiting the
      switch statement which can be done easily enough in the case.
    lib/mime.c: switch statement rewritten as if statement.
    lib/pop3.c: the fallthrough case skips to the next state in the
      statemachine, do this explicitly instead.
    lib/urlapi.c: switch statement rewritten as if statement.
    lib/vssh/wolfssh.c: the fallthrough cases fast-forwards the state
      machine, do this by running another iteration of the switch
      statement instead.
    lib/vtls/gtls.c: switch statement rewritten as if statement.
    lib/vtls/nss.c: the fallthrough codepath is simply copied into the
      case as it's a single line. Also twiddle a comment to not be
      inside a non-brace if statement.

- scripts/copyright: .muse is .lift now
  
  And update 5 files with old copyright year range

- cmdline-opts: made the 'Added:' field mandatory
  
  Since "too old" versions are no longer included in the generated man
  page, this field is now mandatory so that it won't be forgotten and then
  not included in the documentation.
  
  Closes #7786

- curl.1: remove mentions of really old version changes
  
  To make the man page more readable, this change removes all references
  to changes in support/versions etc that happened before 7.30.0 from the
  curl.1 output file. 7.30.0 was released on Apr 12 2013. This particular
  limit is a bit arbitrary but was fairly easy to grep for.
  
  It is handled like this: the 'Added' keyword is only used in output if
  it refers to 7.30.0 or later. All occurances of "(Added in $VERSION)" in
  description will be stripped out if the mentioned $VERSION is from
  before 7.30.0. It is therefore important that the "Added in..."
  references are always written exactly like that - and on a single line,
  not split over two.
  
  This change removes about 80 version number references from curl.1, down
  to 138 from 218.

  On connection shutdown, a new TLS session ticket may arrive after the
  SSL session cache has already been destructed. In this case, the new
  SSL session cannot be added to the SSL session cache.
  
  The callers of Curl_ssl_addsessionid() need to know whether the SSL
  session has been added to the cache. If it has not been added, the
  reference counter of the SSL session must not be incremented, or memory
  used by the SSL session must be freed. This is now possible with the new

- hostip: Make Curl_ipv6works function independent of getaddrinfo
  
  - Do not assume IPv6 is not working when getaddrinfo is not present.
  
  The check to see if IPv6 actually works is now independent of whether
  there is any resolver that can potentially resolve a hostname to IPv6.
  
  Prior to this change if getaddrinfo() was not found at compile time then
  Curl_ipv6works() would be defined as a macro that returns FALSE.
  
  When getaddrinfo is not found then libcurl is built with CURLRES_IPV4
  defined instead of CURLRES_IPV6, meaning that it cannot do IPv6 lookups
  in the traditional way. With this commit if libcurl is built with IPv6
  support (ENABLE_IPV6) but without getaddrinfo (CURLRES_IPV6), and the
  IPv6 stack is actually working, then it is possible for libcurl to
  resolve IPv6 addresses by using DoH.

- connect: fix wrong format specifier in connect error string
  
  0842175 (not in any release) used the wrong format specifier (long int)
  for timediff_t. On an OS such as Windows libcurl's timediff_t (usually
  64-bit) is bigger than long int (32-bit). In 32-bit Windows builds the
  upper 32-bits of the timediff_t were erroneously then used by the next
  format specifier. Usually since the timeout isn't larger than 32-bits
  this would result in null as a pointer to the string with the reason for
  the connection failing. On other OSes or maybe other compilers it could
  probably result in garbage values (ie crash on deref).
  
  Before:
  Failed to connect to localhost port 12345 after 1201 ms: (nil)
  
  After:
  Failed to connect to localhost port 12345 after 1203 ms: Connection refused

  docs: make the documentation for --etag-save match the program behaviour
  
  When using curl with the option `--etag-save` I expected it to save the
  ETag without its surrounding quotes, as stated by the documentation in
  the repository and by the generated man pages.
  
  My first endeavour was to fix the program, but while investigating the
  history of the relevant parts, I discovered that curl once saved the
  ETag without the quotes.  This was undone by Daniel Stenberg in commit
  `98c94596f5928840177b6bd3c7b0f0dd03a431af`, therefore I decided that in
  this case the documentation should be adjusted to match the behaviour of
  curl.
  
  The changed save behaviour also made parts of the `--etag-compare`
  documentation wrong or superfluous, so I adjusted those accordingly.

  Revert "ftp: Expression 'ftpc->wait_data_conn' is always false"
  
  The reverted commit introduced a logic error in code that was
  correct.
  
  The client using libcurl would notice the error since FTP file
  uploads in active transfer mode would somtimes complete with
  success despite no transfer having been performed and the
  "uploaded" file thus not being on the remote server afterwards.
  
  The FTP server would notice the error because it receives a
  RST on the data connection it has established with the client
  before any data was transferred at all.
  
  The logic error happens if the STOR response from the server have
  arrived by the time ftp_multi_statemach() in the affected code path
  is called, but the incoming data connection have not arrived yet.
  In that case, the processing of the STOR response will cause
  'ftpc->wait_data_conn' to be set to TRUE, contradicting the comment
  in the code. Since 'complete' will also be set, later logic would
  believe the transfer was done.
  
  In most cases, the STOR response will not have arrived yet when
  the affected code path is executed, or the incoming connection will
  also have arrived, and thus the error would not express itself.
  But if the speed difference of the device using libcurl and the
  FTP server is exactly right, the error may happen as often as in
  one out of hundred file transfers.
  
  This reverts commit 49f3117a238b6eac0e22a32f50699a9eddcb66ab.

- http: fix crash in rate-limited upload
  
  - Don't set the size of the piece of data to send to the rate limit if
    that limit is larger than the buffer size that will hold the piece.
  
  Prior to this change if CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE
  (curl tool: --limit-rate) was set then it was possible that a temporary
  buffer used for uploading could be written to out of bounds. A likely
  scenario for this would be a non-trivial amount of post data combined
  with a rate limit larger than CURLOPT_UPLOAD_BUFFERSIZE (default 64k).
  
  The bug was introduced in 24e469f which is in releases since 7.76.0.

- vtls: fix warning due to function prototype mismatch
  
  b09c8ee changed the function prototype. Caught by Visual Studio.

- curl_multibyte: Remove local encoding fallbacks
  
  - If the UTF-8 to UTF-16 conversion fails in Windows Unicode builds then
    no longer fall back to assuming the string is in a local encoding.
  
  Background:
  
  Some functions in Windows Unicode builds must convert UTF-8 to UTF-16 to
  pass to the Windows CRT API wide-character functions since in Windows
  UTF-8 is not a valid locale (or at least 99% of the time right now).
  
  Prior to this change if the Unicode encoding conversion failed then
  libcurl would assume, for backwards compatibility with applications that
  may have written their code for non-Unicode builds, attempt to convert
  the string from local encoding to UTF-16.
  
  That type of "best effort" could theoretically cause some type of
  security or other problem if a string that was locally encoded was also
  valid UTF-8, and therefore an unexpected UTF-8 to UTF-16 conversion
  could occur.

- release-notes.pl: also spot common 'closes' typo

- metalink: remove
  
  Warning: this will make existing curl command lines that use metalink to
  stop working.
  
  Reasons for removal:
  
  1. We've found several security problems and issues involving the
     metalink support in curl. The issues are not detailed here. When
     working on those, it become apparent to the team that several of the
     problems are due to the system design, metalink library API and what
     the metalink RFC says. They are very hard to fix on the curl side
     only.
  
  2. The metalink usage with curl was only very briefly documented and was
     not following the "normal" curl usage pattern in several ways, making
     it surprising and non-intuitive which could lead to further security
     issues.
  
  3. The metalink library was last updated 6 years ago and wasn't so
     active the years before that either. An unmaintained library means
     there's a security problem waiting to happen. This is probably reason
     enough.
  
  4. Metalink requires an XML parsing library, which is complex code (even
     the smaller alternatives) and to this day often gets security
     updates.
  
  5. Metalink is not a widely used curl feature. In the 2020 curl user
     survey, only 1.4% of the responders said that they'd are using it. In
     2021 that number was 1.2%. Searching the web also show very few
     traces of it being used, even with other tools.
  
  6. The torrent format and associated technology clearly won for
     downloading large files from multiple sources in parallel.

  cmake: Avoid leaking absolute paths into exported config
  
  The `find_libarary` command resolves the library or framework
  into an absolute path. In case of system frameworks which are
  located within an Xcode-provided SDK this results in the Xcode
  path and SDK version being part of the library path.
  
  Because those library paths end up in the exported CMake config
  importing curl will fail once the Xcode location or SDK version
  changes:
  
  ```cmake
  set_target_properties(CURL::libcurl PROPERTIES
    INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES "${_IMPORT_PREFIX}/include"
    INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES "lber;ldap;/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX11.3.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/SystemConfiguration.framework;OpenSSL::SSL;OpenSSL::Crypto;ZLIB::ZLIB"
  )
  ```
  
  A work-around is to link against system-level frameworks with
  `-framework XYZ`. In case of `SystemConfiguration` we might be able
  to omit the lookup-check because we could assume the framework is
  always present.

  ares: always store IPv6 addresses first
  
  Trying dual-stack on some embedded platform, I noticed that quite
  frequently (20%) libCurl starts from IPv4 regardless the Happy Eyeballs
  timeout value.  After debugging this issue, I noticed that this happens
  if c-ares resolver response for IPv6 family comes before IPv4 (which was
  randomly happening in my tests).
  
  In such cases, because libCurl puts the last resolver response on top of
  the address list, when IPv4 resolver response comes after IPv6 one - the
  IPv4 family starts the connection phase instead of IPv6 family.
  
  The solution for this issue is to always put IPv6 addresses on top of
  the address list, regardless the order of resolver responses.

- ssl: read pending close notify alert before closing the connection
  
  This avoids a TCP reset (RST) if the server initiates a connection
  shutdown by sending an SSL close notify alert and then closes the TCP
  connection.
  
  For SSL connections, usually the server announces that it will close the
  connection with an SSL close notify alert. curl should read this alert.
  If curl does not read this alert and just closes the connection, some
  operating systems close the TCP connection with an RST flag.
  
  See RFC 1122, section 4.2.2.13
  
  If curl reads the close notify alert, the TCP connection is closed
  normally with a FIN flag.
  
  The new code is similar to existing code in the "SSL shutdown" function:
  try to read an alert (non-blocking), and ignore any read errors.

  CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE: preventing wrong IP version from being used
  
  In some situations, it was possible that a transfer was setup to
  use an specific IP version, but due do DNS caching or connection
  reuse, it ended up using a different IP version from requested.
  
  This commit changes the effect of CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE from simply
  restricting address resolution to preventing the wrong connection
  type being used, when choosing a connection from the pool, and
  to restricting what addresses could be used when establishing
  a new connection.
  
  It is important that all addresses versions are resolved, even if
  not used in that transfer in particular, because the result is
  cached, and could be useful for a different transfer with a
  different CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE setting.

  data_pending: check only SECONDARY socket for FTP(S) transfers
  
  Check the FIRST for all other protocols.
  
  This fixes a timeout in an ftps download. The server sends a TLS
  close_notify message in the same packet as the file data. The
  close_notify seems to not be handled in the schannel_recv function, so
  libcurl is not aware that the server has closed the connection. Thus
  libcurl ends up waiting for action on the socket until a timeout is
  reached. With the secondary socket check added to the data_pending
  function, the close_notify is properly handled, and the ftps transfer
  terminates as expected.

- conn: add 'attach' to protocol handler, make libssh2 use it

  function to get used to set things up correctly.

  c-hyper: don't write to set.writeheader if null
  
  Previously if a caller set CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION but did not set a
  CURLOPT_HEADERDATA buffer, Hyper would still attempt to write headers to
  the data->set.writeheader header buffer, even though it is null.  This
  led to NPE segfaults attempting to use libcurl+Hyper with Git, for
  example.
  
  Instead, process the client write for the status line using the same
  logic we use to process the client write for the later HTTP headers,
  which contains the appropriate guard logic. As a side benefit,
  data->set.writeheader is now only read in one file instead of two.

  m4: add security frameworks on Mac when compiling rustls
  
  Previously compiling rustls on Mac would only complete if you also
  compiled the SecureTransport TLS backend, which curl would prefer to
  the Rust backend.
  
  Appending these flags to LDFLAGS makes it possible to compile the
  Rustls backend on Mac without the SecureTransport backend, which means
  this patch will make it possible for Mac users to use the Rustls
  backend for TLS.
