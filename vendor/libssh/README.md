 The SSH library

```

# Why?

Why not ? :) I've began to work on my own implementation of the ssh protocol
because i didn't like the currently public ones.
Not any allowed you to import and use the functions as a powerful library,
and so i worked on a library-based SSH implementation which was non-existing
in the free and open source software world.
