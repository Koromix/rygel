mbedTLS and libssh in multithreaded applications
==================================================

To use libssh with mbedTLS in a multithreaded application, mbedTLS has to be
built with threading support enabled.

If threading support is not available and multi threading is used, ssh_init
will fail.

More information about building mbedTLS with threading support can be found
in the mbedTLS documentation.
