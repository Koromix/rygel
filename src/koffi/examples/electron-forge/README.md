This is a simple example based on electron-forge that uses Koffi.

To run the app, execute the following:

```sh
cd examples/electron-forge
npm install
npm start
```

You can also use electron-forge to package the app directly:

```sh
cd examples/electron-forge
npm install
npm run make
```

Things should just work :)
