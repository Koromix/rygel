This is a simple example to bundle a CLI node.js app that uses Koffi, using [yao-pkg](https://github.com/yao-pkg/pkg).

To run the app, execute the following:

```sh
cd examples/yao-pkg
npm install
npm start
```

You can bundle the script and the native modules with the following command

```sh
cd examples/yao-pkg
npm install
npm run bundle
```
